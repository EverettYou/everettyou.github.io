When two periotic lattices lies on top of each other with a relative twist or a mismatched lattice constant, they can interfere to create a Moire pattern. As shown in the following figure, a Moire pattern has spatial structure on a larger scale than either of the lattice along. The (quasi)periodic pattern forms a larger lattice, known as the Moire superlattice. Experimentally, the Moire superlattice can be realized by stacking 2D materials together, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), molybdenum disulfide and many others. Exciting new physics can emerge on Moire superlattices, including Mott insulators, unconvensional superconductors and possibily new topological phases.

A general intuition is that as the lattice length scale increases, the scale of the kinetic energy of the electron reduces, which makes the interaction effect relatively more important. In fact, band structure calculations reveals that at cirtain twist angles (known as the magic angle), the electronic band around the Fermi energy can become very flat. This opens up a platform for strongly correlated quantum many-body physics to take place. In a recent work with Ashvin Vishwanath, we propse a low-energy effective theory for twisted bilayer graphene and analyze the leading ordering instability including the possible pairing symmtries.
