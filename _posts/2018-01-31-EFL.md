The holographic duality (AdS/CFT) was originally proposed as the correspondence between a $$d$$-dimensional quantum field theory and a $$(d+1)$$-dimensional quantum gravity theory. The information about the space-time geometry in the higher-dimensional holographic bulk is encoded in the quantum many-body dynamics on the lower-dimensional holographic boundary, hence the name "holography". The holographic duality reveals a deep connection between quantum entanglement and space-time geometry:  "Entanglement is the fabric of space-time", said Brain Swingle on [Quantum Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tensor-networks-and-entanglement-20150428/).

One way to envision the structure of quantum entanglement in a many-body system is to represent the quantum many-body wave function in the form of a tensor network (as illustrated in the above figure). One can view each link in the network as an entangled pair state, and each circle as a measurement that projects the local degrees of freedom to a state in the measurement basis. In this way, the unmeasured degrees of freedoms (the open ends of dangling links) will be entangled together to form a quantum many-body state. Although the entangled pair states only possess local two-body entanglement, after the projective measurements, the resulting state can contain very complicated multi-body entanglement. In adversary, the tensor network representation effectively resolves the non-local multi-body entanglement structures in the many-body state as local pairwise network connectivity, at the price of introducing auxiliary tensors in the bulk of the network. The emergent bulk along with its network geometry corresponds to the holographic spacial geometry dual to the quantum many-body state.

Different bulk geometry (tensor network connection) typically leads to different entanglement features in the tensor network state. So given the entanglement features of a many-body state, can we determine the optimal tensor network connectivity that best reproduce the given entanglement features? This smells similar to the problem of training a neural network. Indeed, in this paper ([arXiv:1709.01223](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01223)), we show that optimizing the connectivity of a random tensor network to fit the entanglement features can be mapped to training a deep Boltzmann machine. Using the machine learning techniques, we demonstrate how the emergent holographic bulk grows deeper and deeper as we push the boundary quantum field theory towards the conformal limit. As we serve the entanglement "big-data" to the machine, the machine develops a neural network to capture the features of the data, and as the training goes, the holographic spatial geometry emerges in the bulk as the network geometry.
