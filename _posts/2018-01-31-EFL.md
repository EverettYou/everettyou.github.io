The holographic duality (AdS/CFT) was originally proposed as the correspondence between a $d$-dimensional quantum field theory and a $(d+1)$-dimensional gravity theory. The information about the space-time geometry in the higher-dimensional holographic bulk is encoded in the quantum many-body dynamics on the lower-dimensional holographic boundary, hence the name "holography". The holographic duality reveals a deep connection between quantum entanglement and space-time geometry. "Entanglement is the fabric of space-time", said Brain Swingle in one interview on [Quantum Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tensor-networks-and-entanglement-20150428/).
