The holographic duality (AdS/CFT) was originally proposed as the correspondence between a $$d$$-dimensional quantum field theory and a $$(d+1)$$-dimensional gravity theory. The information about the space-time geometry in the higher-dimensional holographic bulk is encoded in the quantum many-body dynamics on the lower-dimensional holographic boundary, hence the name "holography". The holographic duality reveals a deep connection between quantum entanglement and space-time geometry:  "Entanglement is the fabric of space-time", said Brain Swingle on [Quantum Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tensor-networks-and-entanglement-20150428/).

One way to envision the structure of quantum entanglement in a many-body system is to represent the quantum many-body wave function in the form of tensor network (as illustrated in the above figure). One can view each link in the network as an entangled pair state, and each circle as a measurement that projects the local degrees of freedom to a state in the measurement basis.
