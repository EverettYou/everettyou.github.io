Yi-Zhuang You is an Associate Professor of Physics at the University of California, San Diego. His research lies at the intersection of quantum many-body physics, quantum information science, and machine learning. He is known for pioneering work on symmetric mass generation, entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits, and AI-assisted quantum state learning. Recent efforts focus on developing machine learning algorithms for quantum error correction, quantum tomography, and representation learning of quantum systems. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award and UC Hellman Fellowship, and he serves on the editorial board of *Machine Learning: Science and Technology*.
