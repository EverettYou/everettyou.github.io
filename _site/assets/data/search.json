        "content"  : "<p>When two periodic lattices lie on top of each other with a relative twist or a mismatched lattice constant, they can interfere to create a Moire pattern. As shown in the following figure, a Moire pattern has a spatial structure on a larger scale than either of the lattice along. The (quasi)periodic pattern forms a larger lattice, known as the Moire superlattice. Experimentally, the Moire superlattice can be realized by stacking 2D materials together, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), molybdenum disulfide and many others. Exciting new physics can emerge on Moire superlattices, including Mott insulators, unconventional superconductors and possibly new topological phases.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/figures/twisted_bilayer_graphene.png\" alt=\"Twisted bilayer graphene\" /></p>\n\n<p>A simple intuition is that as the lattice length scale increases, the electronic matter wave also propagates at a longer wave length on the lattice, which corresponds to a lower momentum. Since the kinetic energy of the electron positively correlates with its momentum, the reduced momentum on the superlattice implies a reduced kinetic energy. This makes the interaction energy relatively more important compare to the kinetic energy, resulting in the enhanced interaction effect among the electrons. In fact, band structure calculations reveal that at certain twist angles (known as the magic angle), the electronic band near the Fermi energy can become very flat. This opens up a platform for strongly correlated quantum many-body physics to take place.</p>\n\n<p>Typically there are two approaches to handle these correlated electronic systems: one is the weak coupling approach that start with the electronic band structure and add in interaction perturbatively, another is the strong coupling approach that start with the clusters of electrons with strong local interaction and try to connect them together virtual tunneling processes. In a recent work (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06867\">arXiv:1805.06867</a>) with Ashvin Vishwanath, we propose a low-energy effective theory for twisted bilayer graphene and follow the weak coupling approach to analyze the leading ordering instability including the possible pairing symmetries. My group is also actively exploring from the strong coupling approach to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the correlated physics in these Moire superlattice systems.</p>\n"

        "content"  : "<p>Quantum information dynamics is an emerging field that ties several topics together, including non-equilibrium and driven quantum systems, many-body localization and thermalization, quantum chaos and black holes, tensor network holography. Traditionally, one may think that physics is about the dynamics of matter and spacetime. Extending our scope to the dynamics of quantum information is a new trend, which in turn deepen our understanding of the dynamics of matter and spacetime.</p>\n\n<p>A tool to quantify quantum information is the entanglement entropy, as well as various information measures that can be constructed out of it. A prominent difference between quantum and classical information lies in the phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement is a non-local information storing scheme that can only be realized in quantum systems, where information is not stored in any particular entity that makes up the system but stored in the relationships among the the entities. Therefore any attempt to separate a subsystem out of an entangled quantum system would inevitably cut off its quantum entanglement with the rest of the system, which leads to an information loss, or equivalently an entropy growth. The amount of entropy associated with separating the subsystem is the entanglement entropy, which also quantifies the  entanglement between the subsystem and its counterpart.</p>\n\n<p>For a given quantum many-body state, each choice of the subsystem (which may be disconnected) is associated with an entanglement entropy. Many quantum information measures, such as mutual or tripartite information, can be constructed by adding and subtracting entanglement entropies over different subsystems. So one may attempt to give a full description of quantum information by the collection of entanglement entropies over all possible subsystems. However, the amount of data is enormous. For a system of <script type=\"math/tex\">N</script> qubits, there are totally <script type=\"math/tex\">2^N</script> different choices of subsystem and hence <script type=\"math/tex\">2^N</script> potentially different entanglement entropies. How to arrange the exponentially large amount of data efficiently? One idea is to encode the entanglement entropies in the energy function of a statistical mechanics model.</p>\n\n<p>The intuition is to consider each choice of the subsystem as an Ising configuration, such that the qubits within (outside) the subsystem is marked with a down (up) spin. In this way, we can think of the entanglement entropy of a subsystem as the energy associated to the corresponding Ising configuration. Once the energy function is define, we can follow the principles of statistical mechanics to define a statistical ensemble of subsystems, in which the probability of each choice of the subsystem is proportional to the Boltzmann weight <script type=\"math/tex\">W=e^{-S}</script> set by the entanglement entropy <script type=\"math/tex\">S</script>. This Boltzmann weight was first proposed and named as the entanglement feature in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01223\">arXiv:1709.01223</a>. The entire statistical ensemble encodes the entanglement entropies over all possible subsystems of a given quantum many-body state. For example, a disentangled product state would correspond to the paramagnetic limit of the Ising ensemble where all spin configurations appear with equal probability. On the other hand, a strongly entangled state would correspond to an Ising ensemble with strong ferromagnetic correlation.</p>\n\n<p>As the many-body state evolves with time, the entanglement features also evolves. Therefore we can formulate the dynamics of quantum information as the dynamics of the entanglement features that describes the entanglement Ising ensemble. Our group is working to develop and apply this idea to understand quantum information dynamics in quantum chaotic <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10425\">arXiv:1803.10425</a> or periodic driven systems. This Ising formulation of quantum many-body entanglement turns to to be closely related to tensor network holography, which allows us to explore the corresponding dynamics in holographic bulk as well.</p>\n\n"

        "content"  : "<p>The holographic duality (AdS/CFT) was originally proposed as the correspondence between a <script type=\"math/tex\">d</script>-dimensional quantum field theory and a <script type=\"math/tex\">(d+1)</script>-dimensional quantum gravity theory. The information about the space-time geometry in the higher-dimensional holographic bulk is encoded in the quantum many-body dynamics on the lower-dimensional holographic boundary, hence the name “holography”. The holographic duality reveals a deep connection between quantum entanglement and space-time geometry:  “Entanglement is the fabric of space-time”, said Brain Swingle on <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/tensor-networks-and-entanglement-20150428/\">Quantum Magazine</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/figures/tensor_network.png\" alt=\"Representing quantum many-body state as tensor network\" /></p>\n\n<p>One way to envision the structure of quantum entanglement in a many-body system is to represent the quantum many-body wave function in the form of a tensor network (as illustrated in the above figure). One can view each link in the network as an entangled pair state, and each circle as a measurement that projects the local degrees of freedom to a state in the measurement basis. In this way, the unmeasured degrees of freedoms (the open ends of dangling links) will be entangled together to form a quantum many-body state. Although the entangled pair states only possess local two-body entanglement, after the projective measurements, the resulting state can contain very complicated multi-body entanglement. In adversary, the tensor network representation effectively resolves the non-local multi-body entanglement structures in the many-body state as local pairwise network connectivity, at the price of introducing auxiliary tensors in the bulk of the network. The emergent bulk along with its network geometry corresponds to the holographic spacial geometry dual to the quantum many-body state.</p>\n\n<p>Different bulk geometry (tensor network connection) typically leads to different entanglement features in the tensor network state. So given the entanglement features of a many-body state, can we determine the optimal tensor network connectivity that best reproduce the given entanglement features? This smells similar to the problem of training a neural network. Indeed, in this paper (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01223\">arXiv:1709.01223</a>), we show that optimizing the connectivity of a random tensor network to fit the entanglement features can be mapped to training a deep Boltzmann machine. Using the machine learning techniques, we demonstrate how the emergent holographic bulk grows deeper and deeper as we push the boundary quantum field theory towards the conformal limit. As we serve the entanglement “big-data” to the machine, the machine develops a neural network to capture the features of the data, and as the training goes, the holographic spatial geometry emerges in the bulk as the network geometry.</p>\n"
