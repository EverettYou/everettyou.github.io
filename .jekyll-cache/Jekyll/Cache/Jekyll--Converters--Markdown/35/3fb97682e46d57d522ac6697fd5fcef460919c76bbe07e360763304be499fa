I"Ã<p>The emergent phenomenon is a central theme of condensed matter physics. Not only matter and forces can be emergent, spacetime and gravity could also be emergent. These exciting ideas are being actively explored in the frontier of physics research. But wait a moment, arenâ€™t all these physics theories themselves also emergent phenomena? This is an interesting idea. Physics theories are indeed collective neural activations in humanâ€™s brain. It is unclear how the ideas of physics emerge in the neural network of a physicist, or more generally, in the physics community. Understanding the universal principles of emergent intelligence in complex networks should be one important goal of science.</p>
