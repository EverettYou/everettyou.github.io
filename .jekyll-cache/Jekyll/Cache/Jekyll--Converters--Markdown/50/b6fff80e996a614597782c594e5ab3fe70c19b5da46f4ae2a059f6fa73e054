I"Â<p>The holographic duality (AdS/CFT) was originally proposed as the correspondence between a <script type="math/tex">d</script>-dimensional quantum field theory and a <script type="math/tex">(d+1)</script>-dimensional quantum gravity theory. The information about the space-time geometry in the higher-dimensional holographic bulk is encoded in the quantum many-body dynamics on the lower-dimensional holographic boundary, hence the name ‚Äúholography‚Äù. The holographic duality reveals a deep connection between quantum entanglement and space-time geometry:  ‚ÄúEntanglement is the fabric of space-time‚Äù, said Brain Swingle on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/tensor-networks-and-entanglement-20150428/">Quantum Magazine</a>.</p>
