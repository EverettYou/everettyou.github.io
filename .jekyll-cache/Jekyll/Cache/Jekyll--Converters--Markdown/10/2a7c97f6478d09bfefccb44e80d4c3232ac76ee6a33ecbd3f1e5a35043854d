I"ë<p>Quantum information dynamics is an emerging field that ties several topics together, including non-equilibrium and driven quantum systems, many-body localization and thermalization, quantum chaos and black holes, tensor network holography. Traditionally, one may think that physics is about the dynamics of matter and spacetime. Extending our scope to the dynamics of quantum information is a new trend, which in turn deepen our understanding of the dynamics of matter and spacetime.</p>
