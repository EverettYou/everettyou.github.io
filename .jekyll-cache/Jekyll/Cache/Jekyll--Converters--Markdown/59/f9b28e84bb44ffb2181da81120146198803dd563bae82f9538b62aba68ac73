I"9<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem">Noether theorem</a> is a profound theorem in physics, relating continuous symmetries to conservation laws. The German mathematician Emmy Noether first proved it. Some famous examples include space-time translation symmetry and momentum-energy conservation, rotation symmetry and angular momentum conservation, internal U(1) symmetry and charge conservation. In quantum many-body systems, the discussion of symmetry can be more involved. For example, new symmetry that does not exist in the system can even emerge at low energy. Such a phenomenon generally occurs when the symmetry breaking terms are all irrelevant under the renormalization group (RG) flow in the field theory description. Do emergent symmetries also lead to emergent conservation laws?</p>
