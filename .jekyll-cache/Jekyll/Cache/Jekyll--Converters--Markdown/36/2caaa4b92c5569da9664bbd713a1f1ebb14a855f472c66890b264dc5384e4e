I"«<p>The holographic duality (AdS/CFT) was originally proposed as the correspondence between a \(d\)-dimensional quantum field theory and a \((d+1)\)-dimensional quantum gravity theory. The information about the space-time geometry in the higher-dimensional holographic bulk is encoded in the quantum many-body dynamics on the lower-dimensional holographic boundary, hence the name â€œholographyâ€. The holographic duality reveals a deep connection between quantum entanglement and space-time geometry:  â€œEntanglement is the fabric of space-timeâ€, said Brain Swingle on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/tensor-networks-and-entanglement-20150428/">Quantum Magazine</a>.</p>
