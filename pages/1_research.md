### Correlated Quantum Many-Body System

Quantum mechanics governs the microscopic degrees of freedom of electrons and spins. When strongly interacting, these systems can exhibit exotic collective phenomena beyond the simple sum of individual behaviors. Studying quantum many-body systems has important practical applications, from designing new materials to building quantum devices.
