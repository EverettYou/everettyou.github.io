### Correlated Quantum Many-Body System

Electrons and spins are microscopic degrees of freedom governed by quantum mechanics. When they are put together and interact with each other strongly, exotic collective phenomena can emerge in the system, which goes beyond the simple sum of the behavior of each individual. The study of quantum many-body systems also has important practical applications, ranging from designing correlated materials to making quantum devices.

### Topological Phases of Matter

Discovering new phases of matter lies on the frontier of condensed matter physics. Topological phases are such exotic quantum phases that go beyond our traditional understanding. The study of topological phases has led to many exciting developments in quantum many-body theory. The unique features of topological phases are being tested in current numerical simulations and may also find experimental realizations in the near future.

### Quantum Entanglement Dynamics

Quantum entanglement is the most intriguing phenomenon in quantum mechanics, connecting topics of topological order, many-body localization, and quantum chaos. It also shares a remarkable similarity with wormholes given their non-local nature, which motivates the idea of holographic duality between entanglement and spacetime. Understanding the structure and dynamics of many-body entanglement could allow us to answer some most profound questions about decoherence, thermalization, and (maybe eventually) the nature of gravity.

### Machine Learning and Physics

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising trend of future technology. It is finding more and more applications in all branches of science (including physics). On the other hand, physicists are also bringing their intuitions and tools to the AI research, trying to decipher the nature of intelligence. The combination between machine learning and physics is just at its beginning stage, and much potential is to be released.
