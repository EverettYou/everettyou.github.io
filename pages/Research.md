### Correlated Quantum Many-Body System

Electrons and spins are microscopic degrees of freedom governed by quantum mechanics. When they are put together and interact with each other strongly, exotic collective phenomena can emerge in the system, which goes beyond the simple sum of the behavior of each individual. The study of quantum many-body systems also has important practical applications, ranging from designing correlated materials like high-temperature superconductors to making quantum devices for quantum computation.

### Topological Phases of Matter

Discovering new phases of matter lies on the frontier of condensed matter physics. Topological phases are such exotic quantum phases that go beyond our traditional understanding. The study of topological phases and phase transitions not only deepen our understanding of phases of matter but also generate new developments in various directions including field theory duality and lattice gauge theory. The unique features of topological phases are being tested in the on-going numerical simulations and may also find experiemental realizations in the near future.

### Quantum Enanglement

Entanglement is the most intriguing phenomenon in quantum mechanics that bears no analogy in our classical experience. It is essentially a distributive storage of quantum information in the interrelations (other than the entities) of quantum bits. Quantum entanglement can become very complex in many-body systems. Understanding the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body entanglement would allow us to better answer questions about decoherence, thermalization, and (maybe eventually) the nature of gravity.

### Machine Learning and Physics

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a promissing trend of future technology. It is finding more and more applications in all branches of science (including physics). On the other hand, physicists are also bringing their intuitions and tools to the AI research, trying to decipher the nature of intelligence. The combination between machine learning and physics is just at its beigining stage, much potential is to be released.
