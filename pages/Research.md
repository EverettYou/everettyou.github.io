### Correlated Quantum Many-Body System

Electrons and spins are microscopic degrees of freedom governed by quantum mechanics. When they are put together and interact with each other strongly, exotic collective phenomena can emerge in the system. The study of quantum many-body systems underlies our understanding of correlated materials and quantum devices.

#### Unconvensional Superconductor

- Iron-based superconductors 

- Moire superlattice (twisted multilayer graphene etc.)

#### Quantum Spin Liquid

- Iridates and Kitaev spin liquid

#### Non-Fermi Liquid

- Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model(s)

### Topological Phases of Matter

Discovering new phases of matter lies on the frontier of condensed matter physics. Topological phases are such exotic quantum phases that go beyond our traditional understanding. 

#### Symmetry Protected ~~Topological~~Trivial (SPT) Phases

- Classification of bosonic and fermionic SPT phases

- Bulk SPT order and surface anomaly

#### Intrinsic and Symmetry Enriched Topological (SET) Phases

#### Fracton Topological Order and Gauge Theory

- Higher-form gauge theory

#### Topological Phase Transitions

- Deconfined quantum criticality

- Symmetric mass generation (SMG)

- Web of duality in quantum field theory

### Quantum Enanglement

Entanglement is the most intriguing phenomenon in quantum mechanics that bears no analogy in our classical experience. It is essentially a distributive storage of quantum information in the interrelations (other than the entities) of quantum bits. Quantum entanglement can become very complex in many-body systems. Understanding the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body entanglement would allow us to better answer questions about decoherence, thermalization, and (maybe eventually) the nature of gravity.

#### Many-Body Localization (MBL) and Thermalization

- Spectrum bifurcation renormalization group

- Localization-thermalization transition

#### Entanglement and Tensor Network Holography

#### Eantanglement Feature Dynamics

### Machine Learning and Physics

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a trend of feature technology. It is finding more and more applications in all branches of scientific research, including physics. On the other hand, physicists are also bringing their intuitions and tools to the AI community, trying to decipher the nature of intelligence.
