            "description": "We investigate the performance of large language models on repetitive deterministic prediction tasks and study how the sequence accuracy rate scales with output length. Each such task involves repeating the same operation n times. Examples include letter replacement in strings following a given rule, integer addition, and multiplication of string operators in many body quantum mechanics. If the model performs the task through a simple repetition algorithm, the success rate should decay exponentially with sequence length. In contrast, our experiments on leading large language models reveal a sharp double exponential drop beyond a characteristic length scale, forming an accuracy cliff that marks the transition from reliable to unstable generation. This indicates that the models fail to execute each operation independently. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a statistical physics inspired model that captures the competition between external conditioning from the prompt and internal interference among generated tokens. The model quantitatively reproduces the observed crossover and provides an interpretable link between attention induced interference and sequence level failure. Fitting the model to empirical results across multiple models and tasks yields effective parameters that characterize the intrinsic error rate and error accumulation factor for each model task pair, offering a principled framework for understanding the limits of deterministic accuracy in large language models.",

However, designing efficient circuits, typically constructed from single- and two-qubit gates, remains a major challenge for specific computational tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel artificial intelligence-driven protocol for quantum circuit design, benchmarked using shadow tomography for efficient quantum state readout. Inspired by techniques from natural language processing (NLP), our approach first selects a compact gate dictionary by optimizing the entangling power of two-qubit gates. We identify the iSWAP gate as a key element that significantly enhances sample efficiency, resulting in a minimal gate set of {I, SWAP, iSWAP}. Building on this, we implement a recurrent neural network trained via reinforcement learning to generate high-performing quantum circuits. The trained model demonstrates strong generalization ability, discovering efficient circuit architectures with low sample complexity beyond the training set. Our NLP-inspired framework offers broad potential for quantum computation, including extracting properties of logical qubits in quantum error correction.",

However, when post-measurement states depend on many non-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and using the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new approach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create short-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a superconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range entanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the others. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on observations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by correlating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced entanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability of a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely related to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work can act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more general problems in quantum control.",

The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science.",

To quantify the performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left-or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of , which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site and depth starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equal depth. This advantage is further pronounced for small system sizes and our results are generally robust to finite-size effects.",

The strange correlator exhibits long-range order when evaluated between two distinct NISPTs and decays exponentially otherwise. We show that strange charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are linked to the interface algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial when all its irreducible representations have dimensions greater than one. We discuss the generalization to higher dimensions. The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors. We illustrate the above construction using the three NISPTs of and demonstrate the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the ZX calculus. Finally, we show that the entanglement spectrum degeneracy is determined by the irreducible representations of the interface algebra when assuming non-invertible symmetry on-site condition.",

By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions, and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit\u2019s gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.",

Classical shadows enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single-qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Introducing a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements improves sample efficiency for high-weight Pauli observables and low-rank properties. However, in practice, these circuits can be noisy and bias the measurement results. Here, we propose the robust shallow shadows, which employs Bayesian inference to learn and mitigate noise in postprocessing. We analyze noise effects on sample complexity and the optimal circuit depth. We provide theoretical guarantees for the success of error mitigation under a wide class of\u00a0\u2026",

However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model. Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations, we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases. More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary, providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of matter.",

Unlike previous methods that use machine learning solely as an optimizer, our approach dynamically adjusts quantum circuits based on real-time measurement outcomes and learns distinct preparation protocols for different Hamiltonians. Notably, our machine learning algorithm consistently identifies a state preparation strategy wherein all initial states are first steered toward an intermediate state before transitioning to the target ground state. We demonstrate that performance systematically improves as a larger fraction of ancilla qubits are utilized for measurement and feedback, highlighting the efficacy of mid-circuit measurements in state preparation tasks.",

In recent years, data-driven multiscale modeling has emerged as a promising approach to tackle challenges associated with complex systems. Still, at present,this field is more focused on the prediction or control problems in specific fields, and there is no suitable framework to help us promote the establishment of complex system modeling theory. On the other hand, self-similarity is prevalent in complex systems, hinting that large-scale complex systems can be modeled at a reduced cost. In this paper, we introduce a multiscale neural network framework that incorporates self-similarity as prior knowledge, facilitating the modeling of self-similar dynamical systems. Our framework can discern whether the dynamics are self-similar to deterministic dynamics. For uncertain dynamics, it not only can judge whether it is self-similar or not, but\u00a0\u2026",

Our findings demonstrate that these systems can retain topological information from the SPT ground state despite decoherence. In the''doubled Hilbert space,''we define symmetry-protected topological ensembles (SPT ensembles) and examine boundary anomalies in this space. We generalize the concept of the strange correlator, initially used to diagnose SPT ground states, to identify anomalies in mixed-state density matrices. Through exact calculations of stabilizer Hamiltonians and field theory evaluations, we show that nontrivial features of SPT states persist in two types of strange correlators: type-I and type-II. The type-I strange correlator reveals SPT information that can be efficiently detected and used experimentally, such as in preparing long-range entangled states. The type-II strange correlator encodes the full topological response of the decohered mixed state, reflecting the SPT state's pre-decoherence presence. Our work offers a unified framework for understanding decohered SPT phases from an information-theoretic perspective.",

Recent studies in physics have suggested that the renormalization group (RG) can be conceptualized as a diffusion process. This insight motivates us to develop a diffusion-based generative model by reversing the momentum-space RG flow. We establish a framework that interprets RG flow as optimal transport gradient flow, which minimizes a functional analogous to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, thereby bridging statistical physics and information theory. Our model applies forward and reverse diffusion processes in Fourier space, exploiting the sparse representation of natural images in this domain to efficiently separate signal from noise and manage image features across scales.

These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure, we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG, which shows consistency with known results from K\\\"ahler-Dirac fermion or cobordism classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either 8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization at the field theory level.",

            "description": "In this study, we propose a data-driven, deep-learning-based Machine-Learning Symmetry Discovery (MLSD) algorithm to automate the discovery of continuous Lie group symmetries in classical mechanical systems from their time-evolution trajectory data. MLSD uses neural networks (NNs) to predict conserved physical quantities that implement symmetry transformations of the phase space coordinates. After training, MLSD is able to identify the Lie algebra, particularly non-abelian ones, as indicated by the Lie algebra structure coefficients. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the MLSD method, we applied it to simulated data from the classical three-dimensional Kepler problem and the harmonic oscillator. The results show that the algorithm successfully identified the hidden symmetry groups of both systems.",

            "description": "Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension , the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim ) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim ), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.",

            "description": "The rapid development of quantum technology demands efficient characterization of complex quantum many-body states. However, full quantum state tomography requires an exponential number of measurements in system size, preventing its practical use in large-scale quantum devices. A major recent breakthrough in this direction, called classical shadow tomography, significantly reduces the sample complexity, the number of samples needed to estimate properties of a state, by implementing random Clifford rotations before measurements. Despite many recent efforts, reducing the sample complexity below for extracting any non-successive local operators with a size remains a challenge. In this work, we achieve a significantly smaller sample complexity of using a protocol that hybridizes locally random and globally deterministic unitary operations. The key insight is the discovery of a deterministic global unitary, termed as \\textit{contractive unitary}, which is more efficient in reducing the operator size to enhance tomography efficiency. The contractive unitary perfectly matches the advantages of the atom array quantum computation platform and is readily realized in the atom array quantum processor. More importantly, it highlights a new strategy in classical shadow tomography, demonstrating that a random-deterministic hybridized protocol can be more efficient than fully random measurements.",

To be specific, we define the twisted Gauss law operator and implement the twisted gauging of the finite group on the lattice motivated by the orbifolding procedure in the conformal field theory, which involves the data of non-trivial element in the second cohomology group of the gauge group. We show the twisted gauging is equivalent to the two-step procedure of first applying the SPT entangler and then untwisted gauging. We use the twisted gauging to construct the triality (order 3) and -ality (order ) mapping on the symmetric Hamiltonians, where is a prime. Such novel non-local mappings generalize Kramers-Wannier duality and they preserve the locality of symmetric operators but map charged operators to non-local ones. We further construct quantum process to realize these non-local mappings and analyze the induced mappings on the phase diagrams. For theories that are invariant under these non-local mappings, they admit the corresponding non-invertible symmetries. The non-invertible symmetry will constrain the theory at the multicritical point between the gapped phases. We further give the condition when the non-invertible symmetry can have symmetric gapped phase with a unique ground state.",

By extensive density matrix renormalization group calculations, we observe a remarkable enhancement in binding energy as much as 10\u201320 times larger with increasing from 0 to 12 at .

            "description": "Diffusion models have played a crucial role in the recent advancements in generative image modeling. These models are characterized by a forward process that incrementally corrupts images. The modeling objective is to develop a reverse process capable of reconstructing the original image from degraded inputs so that the trained model can then be leveraged to generate natural images from pure noise. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion process that operates in the frequency domain. Typically, the frequency domain representation of an image exhibits a sparse structure, with energy predominantly concentrated in low frequency components. This inherent sparsity aids us in the effective separation of signal and noise during the reverse process. We utilize this property to introduce a scale-dependent noise schedule, offering precise control over various image scales. Working in the frequency domain\u00a0\u2026",

            "description": "Symmetric mass generation (SMG) insulators are interaction-driven, featureless Mott insulating states in quantum many-body fermionic systems. Recent advancements suggest that zeros in the fermion Green's function could lead to non-vanishing negative optical conductivity in SMG insulators, even below the charge excitation gap. This study explores the origin of this unusual behavior through the lens of pole-zero duality, highlighting a critical issue where the current operator becomes unbounded, rendering the response function unphysical. By employing a lattice model, we derive a well-behaved lattice regularization of the current operator, enabling a detailed study of optical conductivity in SMG insulators. Utilizing both analytical and numerical methods, including strong-coupling expansions, we confirm that SMG insulators exhibit no optical conductivity at low energies below the charge gap, effectively resolving the paradox. This work not only deepens our understanding of quantum many-body phenomena but also lays a robust theoretical groundwork for future experimental explorations of SMG materials.",

Here, interacting Dirac fermions acquire a gap without condensing any fermion bilinear mass term or any concomitant spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is hence beyond the conventional Gross-Neveu-Yukawa-Higgs paradigm. One important question we address in this Letter is whether the SMG transition corresponds to a true unitary conformal field theory. We employ the sharp diagnosis including the scaling of disorder operator and R\u00e9nyi entanglement entropy in large-scale lattice model quantum Monte\u00a0Carlo simulations. Our results strongly suggest that the SMG transition is indeed an unconventional quantum phase transition and it should correspond to a true unitary conformal field theory.",

For this we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity. We first show that dual-unitaries must have a minimal amount of entropy production. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of , which represents the probability of having nontrivial support at site and depth starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for , and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, we demonstrate that the fast-thermalizing properties of dual-unitary circuits make them better at predicting large operators than shallow brick-wall Clifford circuits. Our results are robust to finite-size effects due to the chirality of dual-unitary brick-wall circuits.",

Unlike conventional protocols that perform all measurements by the end of unitary evolutions, our protocol allows measurements to occur at any space-time position throughout the quantum evolution. We provide a universal classical post-processing strategy to approximately reconstruct the original quantum state from intermittent measurement outcomes given the corresponding random circuit realizations over repeated experiments. We investigated the sample complexity for estimating different observables at different measurement rates of the hybrid quantum circuits. Our result shows that the sample complexity has an optimal scaling at the critical measurement\u00a0\u2026",

            "description": "We develop a strong coupling approach towards quantum magnetism in Mott insulators for Wannier-obstructed bands. Despite the lack of Wannier orbitals, electrons can still singly occupy a set of exponentially localized but nonorthogonal orbitals to minimize the repulsive interaction energy. We develop a systematic method to establish an effective spin model from the electron Hamiltonian using a diagrammatic approach. The nonorthogonality of the Mott basis gives rise to multiple new channels of spin-exchange (or permutation) interactions beyond Hartree\u2013Fock and superexchange terms. We apply this approach to a Kagome lattice model of interacting electrons in Wannier-obstructed bands (including both Chern bands and fragile topological bands). Due to the orbital nonorthogonality, as parameterized by the nearest-neighbor orbital overlap g , this model exhibits stable ferromagnetism up to a finite bandwidth W\u223cUg, where U is the interaction strength. This provides an explanation for the experimentally observed robust ferromagnetism in Wannier-obstructed bands. The effective spin model constructed through our approach also opens up the possibility for frustrated quantum magnetism around the ferromagnet-antiferromagnet crossover in Wannier-obstructed bands.",

The argument is based on the perspective that the gapless fermions on the Fermi surface can be viewed as the topological boundary modes of Chern insulators in the phase space (position-momentum space). Given the noncommutative nature of the phase-space coordinates, we show that the momentum space dimensions should be counted as negative dimensions for SPT classification purposes. Therefore, the classification of phase-space Chern insulators (or, more generally fermionic SPT phases) always reduces to a -dimensional problem, which can then be answered by the cobordism approach. In addition to the codimension-1 Fermi surface case, we also discuss the codimension\u00a0\u2026",

For Dirac fermions, with the canonical CRT symmetry , the C-R-T fractionalization has two possibilities that only depend on spacetime dimensions modulo 8, which are order-16 nonabelian groups, including the famous Pauli group. For Majorana fermions, we determine the R-T fractionalization in all spacetime dimensions , which is an order-8 abelian or nonabelian group. For Weyl fermions, we determine the C or T fractionalization in all even spacetime dimensions , which is an order-4 abelian group. For Majorana-Weyl fermions, we only have an order-2 group. We discuss how the Dirac and Majorana mass terms break the symmetries C, R, or T. We study the domain wall dimensional reduction of the fermions and their C-R-T fractionalization: from -dim Dirac to -dim Dirac or Weyl; and from -dim Majorana to -dim Majorana or Majorana-Weyl.",

Applying it to topological edge states in a Chern insulator predicts an enhanced MIM response at the crystal boundaries due to collective edge magnetoplasmon (EMP) excitations. The unique resonance frequency of these plasmonic modes allows one to disentangle the signatures of topological versus trivial edge states.

Unlike traditional data-centric evaluation based on pre-defined test sets, the test set in OmniInput is self-constructed by the model itself and the model quality is evaluated by investigating its output distribution. We employ an efficient sampler to obtain representative inputs and the output distribution of the trained model, which, after selective annotation, can be used to estimate the model's precision and recall at different output values and a comprehensive precision-recall curve. Our experiments demonstrate that OmniInput enables a more fine-grained comparison between models, especially when their performance is almost the same on pre-defined datasets, leading to new findings and insights for how to train more robust, generalizable models.",

It would be beneficial if we could evaluate the difference between human annotation and model prediction for an internet number of inputs, or more generally, for an input space that enumeration is computationally impractical. Traditional model evaluation methods rely on precision and recall (PR) as metrics, which are typically estimated by comparing human annotations with model predictions on a specific dataset. This is feasible because enumerating thousands of test inputs is manageable. However, estimating PR across a large input space is challenging because enumeration becomes computationally infeasible. We propose OmniInput, a novel approach to evaluate and compare NNs by the PR of an input space. OmniInput is distinctive from previous works as its estimated PR reflects the\u00a0\u2026",

Here, we perform unbiased quantum Monte-Carlo simulation and systematically investigate a bilayer fermionic model hosting Fermi surface SMG in the strongly interacting regime. With increasing interaction strength, the model undergoes a quantum phase transition from an exciton insulator to an SMG phase, belonging to the (2+1)-dimensional O(4) universality class. We access the spectral properties of the SMG phase, resembling a Mott insulating phase with relatively flat dispersion and pronounced spectral broadening. The dispersion of Green's function zeros is extracted from spectral function, featuring a surface at zero frequency precisely located at the original non-interacting Fermi surface, which constitutes a hallmark of the Fermi surface SMG phase. The bilayer model we study is potentially relevant to the newly discovered high- superconductor . Our results in SMG phase qualitatively capture the salient features of spectral function unveiled in recent ARPES experiments, shedding new insight on the underlying physics of .",

The SMG insulator preserves all symmetries and has no mean-field interpretation at the single-particle level. It is characterized by zeros in the fermion Green's function, which encapsulate the same Fermi volume in momentum space as the original Fermi surface, a feature mandated by the Luttinger theorem.

Recent studies have demonstrated that symmetric mass generation (SMG) can precisely occur with two copies of K\u00e4hler-Dirac fermions across any space-time dimensions. This conclusion stems from the study of anomaly cancellation within the fermion system. Our research provides an alternative understanding of this phenomenon from a condensed matter perspective, by associating the interacting K\u00e4hler-Dirac fermion with the boundary of bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. We show that the low-energy bosonic fluctuations in a single copy of the K\u00e4hler-Dirac fermion can be mapped to the boundary modes of a -classified bosonic SPT state, protected by an inversion symmetry universally across all dimensions.

The transition does not involve spontaneous symmetry breaking or topological order and has been proposed as an example of the fermionic deconfined quantum critical point (fDQCP).

Through a single-orbital bilayer square lattice model involving intralayer hopping and interlayer superexchange interaction , we demonstrate the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) upon doping the SMG insulator. The SC phase features -wave interlayer spin-singlet pairing and exhibits a crossover between the BCS and BEC limits by tuning the ratio. We estimate the SC transition temperature from both the weak and strong coupling limits at the mean-field level. Our findings offer insights into the experimentally observed decrease in with pressure and the strange metal behavior above . Additionally, we propose that both Ni and orbitals can exhibit superconductivity in La Ni O under pressure, but their should vary in opposite ways under doping. This characteristic difference suggests a potential experimental pathway to identify which electronic orbital plays the principal role in the formation of superconductivity in this system.",

Exhaustive enumeration or traditional Monte Carlo methods for the entire input space can exhibit impractical sampling time, especially for high-dimensional inputs. To make such difficult sampling computationally feasible, in this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-based Wang-Landau (GWL) sampler. We first draw the connection between the output distribution of a NN and the density of states (DOS) of a physical system. Then, we renovate the classic sampler for the DOS problem, Wang-Landau algorithm, by re-placing its random proposals with gradient-based Monte Carlo proposals. This way, our GWL sampler investigates the under-explored subsets of the input space much more efficiently. Extensive experiments have verified the accuracy of the output distribution generated by GWL and also showcased several interesting findings-for example, in a binary image classification task, both CNN and ResNet mapped the majority of human unrecognizable images to very negative logit values.",

            "description": "Classical shadow tomography is a powerful randomized measurement protocol for predicting many properties of a quantum state with few measurements. Two classical shadow protocols have been extensively studied in the literature: the single-qubit (local) Pauli measurement, which is well suited for predicting local operators but inefficient for large operators; and the global Clifford measurement, which is efficient for low-rank operators but infeasible on near-term quantum devices due to the extensive gate overhead. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable classical shadow tomography approach for generic randomized measurements implemented with finite-depth local Clifford random unitary circuits, which interpolates between the limits of Pauli and Clifford measurements. The method combines the recently proposed locally-scrambled classical shadow tomography framework with tensor network techniques to achieve scalability for computing the classical shadow reconstruction map and evaluating various physical properties. The method enables classical shadow tomography to be performed on shallow quantum circuits with superior sample efficiency and minimal gate overhead and is friendly to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We show that the shallow-circuit measurement protocol provides immediate, exponential advantages over the Pauli measurement protocol for predicting quasi-local operators. It also enables a more efficient fidelity estimation compared to the Pauli measurement.",

The previous studies of SMG have been limited to Dirac/Weyl/Majorana fermions with zero Fermi volume in the free fermion limit. In this paper, we generalize the concept of SMG to Fermi liquid (FL) with a finite Fermi volume and discuss how to gap out the Fermi surfaces (FSs) by interactions without breaking the U(1) loop group symmetry or developing topological orders. We provide examples of FS SMG in both -dimensional and -dimensional FL systems when several FSs together cancel the FS anomaly. However, the U(1) loop group symmetry in these cases is still restrictive enough to rule out all possible fermion bilinear gapping terms, such that a nonperturbative interaction mechanism is the only way to gap out the FSs\u00a0\u2026",

We provide an unbiased estimator of the quantum state as a linear combination of reduced classical snapshots in all subsystems, where the combination coefficients are solely determined by the entanglement feature.

Borrowing ideas from the theory of renormalization group (RG) flows in quantum field theory, holographic duality, and hyperbolic geometry and combining them with neural ordinary differential equation techniques, we construct a new algorithmic natural language processing architecture, called the RG-flow categorifier or for short the RG categorifier, which is capable of data classification and generation in all layers. We apply our algorithmic platform to biomedical data sets and show its performance in the field of sequence-to-function mapping. In particular, we apply the RG categorifier to particular genomic sequences of flu viruses and show how our technology is capable of extracting the information from given genomic sequences, finding their hidden symmetries and dominant\u00a0\u2026",

Specifically, we focus on electronic states energetically proximate to Van Hove singularities (VHSs), where a large density of states promotes different interaction-induced symmetry-breaking electronic orders. To resolve the Fermi surface near VHSs, we construct a fermionic hot-spot model and demonstrate that a perpendicular electric field can tune different nesting structures of the Fermi surface. Subsequently, we apply a renormalization group analysis to describe the low-energy phase diagrams of our model under both short-range repulsive interactions as well as realistic (long-range) Coulomb interactions.

We demonstrate our method on synthetic multi-scale image datasets and the CelebA dataset, showing that the disentangled representations enable semantic manipulation and style mixing of the images at different scales. To visualize the latent representations, we introduce receptive fields for flow-based models and show that the receptive fields of RG-Flow are similar to those of convolutional neural networks.

The number of such states can be computed by the Chern numbers at different momentum slices, which fluctuates with changing momentum and depends on the distribution of Weyl points in the Brillouin zone. For realistic systems, it may be difficult to locate the momenta at which these Weyl points and Fermi-arc states appear. Therefore, we extend the analysis of a parametric random matrix model proposed by Walker and Wilkinson to find the statistics of their distributions. Our numerical data shows that Weyl points with opposite polarities are short range correlated, and the Chern number fluctuation only grows linearly for a limited momentum difference before it saturates. We also find that the saturation value scales with the total number of bands. We then compute the short-range correlation length from perturbation theory, and derive the dependence of the Chern number fluctuation on the momentum difference, showing that the saturation results from the short-range correlation.",

In the last few years, it was gradually understood that there is a new mechanism of mass generation for fermions without involving any symmetry breaking within an anomaly-free symmetry group, also applicable to chiral fermions with anomaly-free chiral symmetries. This new mechanism is generally referred to as the symmetric mass generation (SMG). It is realized that the SMG has deep connections with interacting topological insulator/superconductors, symmetry-protected topological states, perturbative local and non-perturbative global anomaly cancellations, and deconfined quantum criticality. It has strong implications for the lattice regularization of chiral gauge theories. This article defines the SMG, summarizes the current numerical results, introduces an unifying theoretical framework (including the parton-Higgs and the s-confinement mechanisms, as well as the symmetry-extension construction), and presents an overview of various features and applications of SMG.",

In contrast, in our work, we introduce an alternative view that the SM is a low energy quantum vacuum arising from various neighbor vacua competition in an immense quantum phase diagram. In general, we can regard the SM arising near the gapless quantum criticality (either critical points or critical regions) between the competing neighbor vacua. In particular detail, we demonstrate how the SM with 16n Weyl fermions arises near the quantum criticality between the GUT competition of Georgi-Glashow and Pati-Salam . We propose two enveloping toy models. Model I is the conventional GUT with a Spin(10) gauge group plus GUT-Higgs\u00a0\u2026",

In this Letter, we present the density matrix renormalization group simulation of the 3-4-5-0 model of chiral fermions with an anomaly-free chiral U(1) symmetry, which contains two left-moving and two right-moving fermions carrying U(1) charges 3,4 and 5,0, respectively. Following the Wang-Wen chiral fermion model, we realize the chiral fermions and their mirror partners on the opposite boundaries of a thin strip of lattice model of multilayer Chern insulator, whose finite width implies the quantum system is effectively . By introducing two sets of carefully designed six-fermion local interactions to the mirror sector only, we demonstrate that the mirror fermions can be gapped out by the interaction beyond a critical strength without breaking the chiral U(1) symmetry, via the symmetric mass generation mechanism\u00a0\u2026",

We find that interactions select the intervalley coherent order (IVC) as the preferred ordering channel over a wide range, whose theoretically determined phase boundaries agree well with experiments on both the hole- and electron-doped sides. The Fermi surfaces near van Hove singularities admit partial nesting between valleys, which promotes both intervalley superconductivity and IVC fluctuations. We investigate the interplay between these fluctuations and the Hunds (intervalley spin) interaction using a renormalization group approach. For antiferromagnetic Hund's coupling, intervalley pairing appears in the spin-singlet channel with enhanced that scales with the dimensionless\u00a0\u2026",

Our technique performs shadow tomography on a logical state to produce a memory-efficient classical reconstruction of the noisy density matrix. Using efficient classical post-processing, one can mitigate errors by projecting a general nonlinear function of the noisy density matrix into the codespace. The subspace expansion and virtual distillation can be viewed as special cases of the new framekwork. We show our method is favorable in the quantum and classical resources overhead. Relative to subspace expansion which requires samples to estimate a logical Pauli observable with error correction code, our technique requires only samples. Relative to virtual distillation, our technique can compute powers of the density matrix without additional copies of quantum states or quantum memory. We present numerical evidence using logical states encoded with up to sixty physical qubits and show fast convergence to error-free expectation values with only samples under 1% depolarizing noise.",

Unidirectional coherence delocalization (coherence prepared in one cavity transferred to another cavity) has been observed in frequency and real space. This directionality is enabled by the dissipation of delocalized photon from high\u2010energy to low\u2010energy modes, described by Lindblad dynamics. Further experiments show that when coherences are directly prepared between polaritons from different cavities, only energetically nearby polaritons can form coherences that survive the long\u2010range environmental fluctuation.

            "description": "Classical shadow tomography provides an efficient method for predicting functions of an unknown quantum state from a few measurements of the state. It relies on a unitary channel that efficiently scrambles the quantum information of the state to the measurement basis. Facing the challenge of realizing deep unitary circuits on near-term quantum devices, we explore the scenario in which the unitary channel can be shallow and is generated by a quantum chaotic Hamiltonian via time evolution. We provide an unbiased estimator of the density matrix for all ranges of the evolution time. We analyze the sample complexity of the Hamiltonian-driven shadow tomography. For Pauli observables, we find that it can be more efficient than the unitary-2-design-based shadow tomography in a sequence of intermediate time windows that range from an order-1 scrambling time to a timescale of , given the Hilbert space dimension \u2026",

Yet the assumption of static geometry lead to an exponentially small mutual information between far-separated disjoint regions, which does not hold in many systems such as free fermion conformal field theories. In this paper, we proposed a microscopic model by superimposing entanglement features of an ensemble of random tensor networks of different bond dimensions, which can be mapped to a statistical gravity model consisting of a massive scalar field on a fluctuating background geometry. We propose a machine-learning algorithm that recovers the underlying geometry fluctuation from multi-region entanglement entropy data by modeling the bulk geometry distribution via a generative neural network. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we tested the model on a free fermion system and showed mutual information can be\u00a0\u2026",

The multicriticality is described by the theory with Gross-Neveu couplings and falls in a different universality class than the standard deconfined quantum criticality. We systematically calculate the scaling dimensions of various operators in the 3D quantum electrodynamics with the Chern-Simons term and Gross-Neveu couplings by the large- renormalization group analysis.

We formulate decoherent dynamics induced by continuous quantum non-demolition measurements of the instantaneous Hamiltonian. We generalize the well-studied universal Kibble-Zurek behavior for linear temporal drive across the critical point. We identify a strong decoherence regime wherein the decoherence time is shorter than the standard correlation time, which varies as the inverse gap above the groundstate. In this regime, we find that the freeze-out time for when the system falls out of equilibrium and the associated freeze-out length show power-law scaling with respect to the quench rate , where the exponents depend on the correlation length exponent and the dynamical exponent associated with the transition. The universal exponents differ from those of standard Kibble-Zurek scaling. We explicitly demonstrate this scaling behavior in the instance of a topological transition in a Chern insulator system. We show that the freeze-out time scale can be probed from the relaxation of the Hall conductivity. Furthermore, on introducing disorder to break translational invariance, we demonstrate how quenching results in regions of imbalanced excitation density characterized by an emergent length scale which also shows universal scaling. We perform numerical simulations to confirm our analytical predictions and corroborate the scaling arguments that we postulate as universal to a host of systems.",

            "description": "The neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) is a novel machine learning architecture whose weights are smooth functions of the continuous depth. We apply the neural ODE to holographic QCD by regarding the weight functions as a bulk metric, and train the machine with lattice QCD data of chiral condensate at finite temperature. The machine finds consistent bulk geometry at various values of temperature and discovers the emergent black hole horizon in the holographic bulk automatically. The holographic Wilson loops calculated with the emergent machine-learned bulk spacetime have consistent temperature dependence of confinement and Debye-screening behavior. In machine learning models with physically interpretable weights, the neural ODE frees us from discretization artifact leading to difficult ingenuity of hyperparameters, and improves numerical accuracy to make the model more trustworthy.",

Below this threshold, a steady state with a subthermal volume law entanglement emerges, which is resistant to the disentangling action of measurements, suggesting a connection to quantum error-correcting codes. We quantify these notions by identifying a power-law decay of the mutual information in the volume-law-entangled phase, between a qudit located a distance from the boundary of a region , and the complement , which implies that a measurement of this qudit will retrieve very little information about . We also find a universal logarithmic contribution to the volume law entanglement entropy which is intimately related to the first observation. We obtain these results by relating the\u00a0\u2026",

These are the disordered analogs of gapless topological phases. Using real-space and density matrix renormalization group approaches, we analyze the boundary and bulk critical behavior of such symmetry-enriched random quantum spin chains. We uncover a new class of symmetry-enriched infinite randomness fixed points: while local bulk properties are indistinguishable from conventional random singlet phases, nonlocal observables, and boundary critical behavior are controlled by a different renormalization group fixed point. We also illustrate how such new quantum critical points emerge naturally in Floquet systems.",

According to this theory, the critical point of a purely edge topological phase transition of a 2d topological order can be mathematically characterized by an enriched fusion category. In this work, we provide a physical proof of this fact in a concrete example: the 2d topological order. In particular, we construct an enriched fusion category, which describes a gappable nonchiral gapless edge of the 2d topological order. Then, we use an explicit lattice model construction to realize a topological phase transition between the two well-known gapped edges of the 2d topological order, and show that all the ingredients of the above enriched fusion category can be realized explicitly in this lattice model.",

In this case, the average entanglement entropy follows a Markovian dynamics, such that the entanglement property of the future state can be inferred from the entanglement property of the unitary operator of the underlying quantum dynamics. We introduce the entanglement feature formulation to concisely organize the entanglement entropies over all subsystems into a many-body wave function, which allows us to describe the entanglement dynamics using an imaginary-time Schr\u00f6dinger equation, such that various tools developed in quantum many-body physics can be applied.

However, designing the optimal holographic mapping is challenging. Here we introduce the neural network renormalization group as a universal approach to design generic EHM for interacting field theories. Given a field theory action, we train a flow-based hierarchical deep generative neural network to reproduce the boundary field ensemble from uncorrelated bulk field fluctuations. In this way, the neural network develops the optimal renormalization-group transformations. Using the machine-designed EHM to map the CFT back to a bulk effective action, we determine the bulk geodesic distance from the residual mutual information. We have shown that the geometry measured in this way is the classical saddle-point geometry. We\u00a0\u2026",

A quantum neural network distills the information from the input wave function into the output qubits.

This observation motivates us to use the tripartite information\u2014a quantity recently developed to characterize information scrambling\u2014to diagnose the training dynamics of quantum neural networks. We empirically find strong correlation between the dynamical behavior of the tripartite information and the loss function in the training process, from which we identify that the training process has two stages for randomly initialized networks.

Using a replica approach, we map the calculation of the entanglement entropies in such circuits onto a two-dimensional statistical-mechanics model. In this language, the area- to volume-law entanglement transition can be interpreted as an ordering transition in the statistical-mechanics model. We derive the general scaling properties of the entanglement entropies and mutual information near the transition using conformal invariance. We analyze in detail the limit of infinite on-site Hilbert space dimension in which the statistical-mechanics model maps onto percolation. In particular, we compute the exact value of the universal coefficient of the logarithm of subsystem size in the R\u00e9nyi entropies for in this limit using relatively recent results for the conformal field\u00a0\u2026",

Due to a mixed anomaly between time reversal symmetry and the one-form center symmetry, the low-energy dynamics cannot be symmetric trivially gapped. We focus on two possible scenarios: (1) time reversal symmetry is spontaneously broken by the two confining vacua and (2) a deconfined, gapless, and time reversal symmetric Maxwell gauge theory [e.g., spin liquid in condensed matter]. In the first scenario, we find that the antiunitary time reversal symmetry in the bulk induces a unitary symmetry on the domain wall between the two vacua. We discuss how the Lorentz symmetry and the unitary symmetry enrich the domain-wall topological field theory.

Using the infinite density matrix renormalization group (IDMRG) method, we verify the existence of an intermediate plaquette valence bond solid (PVBS) order, with twofold degeneracy, between the dimer and N\u00e9el ordered phases. We argue that the quantum phase transition between the N\u00e9el and PVBS orders may be described by a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) with an emergent O(4) symmetry . By analyzing the correlation length spectrum obtained from IDMRG, we provide evidence for the DQCP and emergent O(4) symmetry in the lattice model.

An example of such an \u201centanglement phase transition\u201d is provided by the many-body localization transition in disordered quantum systems, as it separates highly entangled thermal states at weak disorder from many-body localized states with low entanglement at strong disorder. In the spirit of random matrix theory, we describe a simple model for such transitions where a physical quantum many-body system lives at the \u201cholographic\u201d boundary of a bulk random tensor network. Using a replica trick approach, we map the calculation of the entanglement properties of the boundary system onto the free energy cost of fluctuating domain walls in a classical statistical mechanics model. This allows us to interpret transitions between volume-law and area-law scaling of entanglement as ordering transitions in this\u00a0\u2026",

As a benchmark and a proof-of-principle study of this possibility, here we show an introspective learning architecture that can automatically develop the concept of the quantum wave function and discover the Schr\u00f6dinger equation from simulated experimental data of the potential-to-density mappings of a quantum particle. This introspective learning architecture contains a machine translator to perform the potential to density mapping, and a knowledge distiller auto-encoder to extract the essential information and its update law from the hidden states of the translator, which turns out to be the quantum wave function and the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. We envision that our introspective learning architecture can enable machine learning to discover new physics in the future.",

While great efforts have been spent on the DQCP for 2D systems, both theoretically and numerically, ambiguities among the nature of the transition are still not completely clarified. Here we shift the focus to a recently proposed 1D incarnation of DQCP in a spin-1/2 chain. By solving it with the variational matrix product state in the thermodynamic limit, a continuous transition between a valence-bond solid phase and a ferromagnetic phase is discovered. The scaling dimensions of various operators are calculated and compared with those from field theoretical description. At the critical point, two emergent symmetries are revealed, and the associated conserved current operators with exact integer scaling dimensions are determined with\u00a0\u2026",

In this work, we generalize this lattice construction to dualities with non-Abelian gauge fields. We construct the Euclidean space-time lattice path integral for a theory with strongly interacting vector bosons and Majorana fermions coupled to an gauge field and derive an exact duality between this theory and the theory of a free Majorana fermion on the space-time lattice. We argue that this lattice duality implies the desired infrared duality between the field theory with an vector critical boson coupled to an Chern-Simons gauge theory, and a free massless Majorana fermion in 2+1D. We also generalize the lattice construction of dualities to models with gauge fields.",

            "description": "The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model incorporates rich physics, ranging from exotic non-Fermi liquid states without quasiparticle excitations, to holographic duality and quantum chaos. However, its experimental realization remains a daunting challenge due to various unnatural ingredients of the SYK Hamiltonian such as its strong randomness and fully nonlocal fermion interaction. At present, constructing such a nonlocal Hamiltonian and exploring its dynamics is best through digital quantum simulation, where state-of-the-art techniques can already handle a moderate number of qubits. Here, we demonstrate a first step towards simulation of the SYK model on a nuclear-spin-chain simulator. We observed the fermion paring instability of the non-Fermi liquid state and the chaotic-nonchaotic transition at simulated temperatures, as was predicted by previous theories. As the realization of the SYK model in practice, our\u00a0\u2026",

Here we explore the role of Noether\u2019s theorem at the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), which is a quantum phase transition beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. It was expected that a larger continuous symmetry could emerge at the DQCP, which, if true, should lead to conserved current at low energy. By identifying the emergent current fluctuation in the spin excitation spectra, we can quantitatively study the current-current correlation in large-scale quantum Monte\u00a0Carlo simulations. Our results reveal the conservation of the emergent current, as signified by the vanishing anomalous dimension of the current operator, and hence provide supporting evidence for the emergent symmetry at the DQCP.

Here, we develop a weak coupling approach to the superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene, starting from the Fermi liquid regime. A key observation is that near half filling, the fermiology consists of well nested Fermi pockets derived from opposite valleys, leading to enhanced valley fluctuation, which in turn can mediate superconductivity. This scenario is studied within the random phase approximation. We find that inter-valley electron pairing with either chiral ( d +\u2009i d mixed with p \u2212i p ) or helical form factor is the dominant instability. An approximate SO(4) spin-valley symmetry implies a near degeneracy of spin-singlet and triplet pairing. On increasing interactions, commensurate inter-valley coherence wave (IVCW) order can arise, with simultaneous condensation at\u00a0\u2026",

Later, group supercohomology was proposed as a partial classification for SPT phases of interacting fermions. In this work, we revisit this problem based on the algebraic theory of symmetry and defects in two-dimensional topological phases. We reproduce the partial classifications given by group supercohomology, and we also show that with an additional structure, a complete classification of SPT phases for two-dimensional interacting fermion systems with a total symmetry group is obtained. We also discuss the classification of interacting fermionic SPT phases protected by time-reversal symmetry.",

We obtained the general formula for time-dependent th-Renyi entanglement features for unitary gates generated by random Hamiltonian. In particular, we propose an Ising formulation for the 2nd-Renyi entanglement features of random Hamiltonian dynamics, which admits a holographic tensor network interpretation. As a general description of entanglement properties, we show that the entanglement features can be applied to several dynamical measures of thermalization, including the out-of-time-order correlation and the entanglement growth after a quantum quench. We also analyze the Yoshida-Kitaev probabilistic protocol for random Hamiltonian dynamics.",

In this work, we investigate such a transition in a (2+1)-dimensional lattice model with the maximal microscopic symmetry: an internal symmetry. We derive a description for this transition in terms of compact quantum electrodynamics (QED) with four fermion flavors ( ). Within a systematic renormalization group analysis, we identify the critical point with the desired emergent symmetry and all expected deformations. By lowering the microscopic symmetry, we recover the previous noncompact QED description of the BTT. Finally, by merging two BTTs we recover a previously discussed theory of symmetric mass generation, as an quantum chromodynamics-Higgs theory with flavors of fundamental fermions and one fundamental\u00a0\u2026",

We develop a concrete algorithm, call the entanglement feature learning (EFL), based on the random tensor network (RTN) model for the tensor network holography. We show that each RTN can be mapped to a Boltzmann machine, trained by the entanglement entropies over all subregions of a given quantum many-body state. The goal is to construct the optimal RTN that best reproduce the entanglement feature. The RTN geometry can then be interpreted as the emergent holographic geometry. We demonstrate the EFL algorithm on a 1D free fermion system and observe the emergence of the hyperbolic geometry ( spatial geometry) as we tune the fermion system\u00a0\u2026",

            "description": "Massless Dirac fermions arise in a variety of systems from graphene to the surfaces of topological insulators, where generating a mass is typically associated with breaking a symmetry. However, with strong interactions, a symmetric gapped phase can arise for multiples of eight Dirac fermions. A continuous quantum phase transition from the massless Dirac phase to this massive phase, which we term symmetric mass generation, is necessarily beyond the Landau paradigm and is hard to describe even at the conceptual level. Nevertheless, such transition has been consistently observed in several numerical studies recently. Here, we propose a theory for the symmetric mass generation transition which is reminiscent of deconfined criticality and involves emergent non-Abelian gauge fields coupled both to Dirac fermions and to critical Higgs bosons. We motivate the theory using an explicit parton construction\u00a0\u2026",

Recent numerical progresses suggest that this easy-plane dQCP does exist and it has an emergent O(4) symmetry. But for the O(4) symmetry to really emerge at the dQCP, certain O(4) symmetry breaking perturbations need to be irrelevant at the putative O(4) fixed point. It is more convenient to study these symmetry breaking perturbations in the noncompact QED . We demonstrate that a natural large- generalization and a controlled expansion supports the stability of the O(4) fixed point against the symmetry breaking perturbations. We also develop the theory for two tricritical points close to the easy-plane dQCP. One tricritical point is between the dQCP and a {\\it self-dual} topological order; the other is the tricritical point that connects the continuous dQCP and a first order N\\'{e}el-VBS transition, motivated by recent numerical results.",

In this paper, we generalize the random tensor network approach to allow quantum superposition of different spatial geometries. We setup a framework in which all possible bulk spatial geometries, characterized by weighted adjacient matrices of all possible graphs, are mapped to the boundary Hilbert space and form an overcomplete basis of the boundary. We name such an overcomplete basis as holographic coherent states. A generic boundary state can be expanded in this basis, which describes the state as a superposition of different spatial geometries in the bulk.

In particular, it was realized that different Lagrangians may be related by hidden dualities; i.e., seemingly different field theories may actually be identical in the infrared limit. Among all the proposed dualities, one has attracted particular interest in the field of strongly correlated quantum-matter systems: the one relating the easy-plane noncompact model ( ) and noncompact quantum electrodynamics (QED) with two flavors ( ) of massless two-component Dirac fermions. The easy-plane model is the field theory of the putative deconfined quantum-critical point separating a planar ( ) antiferromagnet and a dimerized (valence-bond solid) ground state, while noncompact QED is the theory for the transition between a bosonic symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial Mott insulator.

We show that the maximal chaotic non-Fermi-liquid phase described by the ordinary SYK model has marginally relevant or irrelevant (depending on the sign of the coupling constants) four-fermion perturbations allowed by symmetry. Changing the sign of one of these four-fermion perturbations leads to a continuous chaotic-nonchaotic quantum phase transition of the system accompanied by a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Starting with the model with a -fermion interaction, similar perturbations can lead to a series of new fixed points with continuously varying exponents.",

Although BSPT states have been classified by various approaches, there is so far no successful experimental realization of any BSPT state in two or higher dimensions. In this paper, we propose that a two-dimensional BSPT state with symmetry can be realized in bilayer graphene in a magnetic field. Here the two symmetries represent total spin and total charge conservation, respectively. The Coulomb interaction plays a central role in this proposal\u2014it gaps out all the fermions at the boundary, so that only bosonic charge and spin degrees of freedom are gapless and protected at the edge.

We find that the boundary is thermalized and investigate how its boundary anomaly, dictated by the bulk SPT order, is encoded in the quantum chaotic eigenspectrum of the SYK model. We show that depending on the SPT symmetry class, the boundary many-body level statistics cycle in a systematic manner through those of the three different Wigner-Dyson random matrix ensembles with a periodicity in the topological index that matches the interaction-reduced classification of the bulk SPT states.

            "description": "We study a lattice model of interacting Dirac fermions in dimensions space-time with an SU(4) symmetry. While increasing the interaction strength, this model undergoes a continuous quantum phase transition from a weakly interacting Dirac semimetal to a fully gapped and nondegenerate phase without condensing any Dirac fermion bilinear mass operator. This unusual mechanism for mass generation is consistent with recent studies of interacting topological insulators/superconductors, and also consistent with recent progress in the lattice QCD community.",

            "description": "Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases in free fermion and interacting bosonic systems have been classified, but the physical phenomena of interacting fermionic SPT phases have not been fully explored. Here, employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the edge physics of a bilayer Kane-Mele-Hubbard model with zigzag ribbon geometry. Our unbiased numerical results show that the fermion edge modes are gapped out by interaction, while the bosonic edge modes remain gapless at the boundary, before the bulk quantum phase transition to a topologically trivial phase. Therefore, finite fermion gaps both in the bulk and on the edge, together with the robust gapless bosonic edge modes, prove that our system becomes an emergent bosonic SPT phase at low energy, which is directly observed in an interacting fermion lattice model.",

We find that the spin gap persists in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, but generally vanishes provided more generic symmetry-allowed interactions exist. We formulate the generic expansion of the spin operator in terms of fractionalized Majorana fermion operators according to the symmetry enriched topological order of the Kitaev spin liquid, described by its projective symmetry group. The dynamical spin structure factor displays power-law scaling bounded by Dirac cones in the vicinity of the , , and points of the Brillouin zone, rather than the spin gap found for the exactly soluble point.",

We argue that, with sufficiently strong disorder, these spin-glass phases are separated by marginally MBL critical lines. We examine the critical lines of this model by measuring the entanglement entropy and Edwards-Anderson spin-glass order parameter, and find that the critical lines are characterized by an effective central charge . Our data also suggest continuously varying critical exponents along the critical lines. We also demonstrate how long-range mutual information [introduced in C.-M.

We start from eight copies of 3D time-reversal invariant topological superconductors (TSC) on a crystal lattice. We melt the lattice by condensation of disclinations and therefore restore the rotation symmetry. Such a disclination condensation procedure confines the fermion and afterwards turns the system into a 3D boson topological liquid crystal (TCL). The low energy effective theory of this crystalline-liquid transition contains a topological term inherited from the geometry axion response in TSC. In addition, we investigate the interplay between dislocation and superfluid vortex on the surface of TCL. We demonstrate that the and translation invariant surface state is a double state with intrinsic surface topological order. We also look into the exotic behavior of dislocation in the 2D\u00a0\u2026",

A strong SPT phase is protected by the internal symmetry only while a weak SPT phase, fabricated by alignment of a strong SPT state in a lower dimension, requires additional discrete translation symmetry protection. In this paper, we construct a phase transition between weak and strong SPT phase in a strongly interacting boson system. The starting point of our construction is the superconducting Dirac fermions with pair density wave (PDW) order in . We first demonstrate that the nodal line of the PDW contains a boson SPT phase. We further show that melting the PDW stripe and condensing the nodal line provoke the transition from weak to strong SPT phase in . The phase transition theory contains an O(4) nonlinear\u00a0\u2026",

Thus a controlled study of the competition between topology and correlation is of great interest. Here, employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide a concrete example of the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model on an AA-stacking bilayer honeycomb lattice with interlayer antiferromagnetic interaction. Our simulation identified several different phases: a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSH), an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator, and an interlayer dimer-singlet insulator. Most importantly, a bona fide topological phase transition between the QSH and the dimer-singlet insulators, purely driven by the interlayer antiferromagnetic interaction, is found. At the transition, the spin and charge gap of the system close while the single-particle excitations remain gapped, which means that this\u00a0\u2026",

This is because due to interaction, the fermions are gapped both at the boundary of the SPT states and at the bulk quantum phase transition, thus these models at low energy can be described completely by bosonic degrees of freedom. We show that the bulk of these models is described by a ) principal chiral model with a topological term, whose boundary is described by a ) principal chiral model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term at level 1. The quantum phase transition between SPT states in the bulk is tuned by a particular interaction term, which corresponds to tuning in the field theory, and the phase transition occurs at .

Starting from a disordered many-body Hamiltonian in the full many-body localized (MBL) phase, SBRG flows to the MBL fixed-point Hamiltonian, and generates the local integrals of motion and the matrix product state representations for all eigenstates. The method is applicable to many interacting spin and fermion models in the full MBL phase. As a Hilbert-space preserving RG, SBRG also generates an entanglement holographic mapping, which duals the MBL state to a fragmented holographic space.",

This photon phase is stable against any weak perturbation without assuming any symmetry. Further works concluded that certain lattice models give rise to more exotic stable algebraic Bose liquid phases with graviton-like excitations. In this paper we will show how these algebraic Bose liquid states can be generalized to stable phases with even more exotic types of gapless excitations and then argue that these new phases are stable against weak perturbations. We also explicitly show that these theories have an (algebraic) topological ground state degeneracy on a torus, and construct the corresponding topological invariants.",

This boundary theory is described by a -dimensional quantum electrodynamics with two flavors of Dirac fermions coupled with a noncompact U(1) gauge field, L=\u2211j=12\u03c8\u00afj\u03b3\u03bc(\u2202\u03bc\u2212ia\u03bc)\u03c8j\u2212iA\u03bcs\u03c8i\u00af\u03b3\u03bc\u03c4ijz\u03c8j+i2\u03c0\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1a\u03bc\u2202\u03bdA\u03c1e, where is the internal noncompact U(1) gauge field, and and are two external gauge fields that couple to and global symmetries, respectively. We demonstrate that this theory has a \u201cself-dual\u201d structure, which is a fermionic analog of the self-duality of the noncompact theory with easy plane anisotropy. Under the self-duality, the boundary action takes exactly the same form except for an\u00a0\u2026",

In this work, we demonstrate that the strange correlator is a sensitive diagnosis to detect SPT states in interacting systems. Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we investigate the interaction-driven quantum phase transition in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. The transition from the quantum spin Hall insulator at weak interaction to an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator at strong interaction can be readily detected by the momentum space behavior of the strange correlator in single-particle, spin, and pairing sectors.

If the symmetry of the system is unitary, then a formal way to determine whether a -dim theory must be a boundary or not, is to couple this theory to a gauge field (or to \u201cgauge\u201d its symmetry), and check if there is a gauge anomaly. In this paper we discuss the following question: Can the boundary of a SPT state be driven into a fully gapped topological order which preserves all the symmetries? We argue (conjecture) that if the gauge anomaly of the boundary is \u201cperturbative,\u201d then the boundary must remain gapless; while if the boundary only has global gauge anomaly but no perturbative anomaly, then it is possible to gap out the boundary by driving it into a topological state, when .

That is, which Hamiltonians with an SPT ground state have finite energy density excited states which are all localized by disorder? Based on the observation that a finite energy density state, if localized, can be viewed as the ground state of a local Hamiltonian, we propose a simple (though possibly incomplete) rule for many-body localization of SPT Hamiltonians: If the ground state and top state (highest energy state) belong to the same SPT phase, then it is possible to localize all the finite energy density states; If the ground and top state belong to different SPT phases, then most likely there are some finite energy density states which can not be fully localized. We will give concrete examples of both scenarios. In some of these examples, we argue that interaction can actually \"assist\" localization of finite energy density states, which is counter-intuitive to what is usually expected.",

            "description": "Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that an extended Hubbard model on a bilayer honeycomb lattice has two novel quantum phase transitions. The first is a quantum phase transition between the weakly interacting gapless Dirac fermion phase and a strongly interacting fully gapped and symmetric trivial phase, which cannot be described by the standard Gross-Neveu model. The second is a quantum critical point between a quantum spin Hall insulator with spin conservation and the previously mentioned strongly interacting fully gapped phase. At the latter quantum critical point the single-particle excitations remain gapped, while spin and charge gaps both close. We argue that the first quantum phase transition is related to the classification of the topological superconductor phase with interactions, while the second quantum phase transition is a topological phase transition\u00a0\u2026",

Representation of modular transformations on the ground states (modular matrices) characterizes the topological order. We show that the modular matrices can be numerically measured as the non-Abelian Berry phase of adiabatic deformations of the lattice model placed on a torus. We apply this method to the example of a gauged superconductor, and show that the result is consistent with the topological quantum field theory descriptions.",

We define a SPT state as whether it is separated from the trivial state through a bulk phase transition, which is a general definition applicable to SPT states with or without spatial symmetries. We show that in all dimensions short-range interactions can reduce the classification of free-fermion SPT states, and we demonstrate these results by making a connection between the fermionic and bosonic SPT states. We first demonstrate that our formalism gives the correct classification for several known SPT states, with or without interaction, and then we generalize our method to SPT states that involve the spatial inversion symmetry.",

Based on the general features of multi-bands and intermediate coupling strengths, a phenomenological theory based on the coexistence of the itinerant electrons and local moments has been proposed to describe the low-energy physics in iron-based superconductors.

We demonstrate, supported by theoretical simulations, that this in-gap state originates from weak scattering between bands with opposite sign of the superconducting-gap phase. This weak scattering, likely due to off-plane nonmagnetic (Ba, K) disorder, occurs mostly among neighboring Fermi surfaces, suggesting that the superconducting-gap phase changes sign within holelike (and electronlike) bands.

            "description": "The string-net approach by Levin and Wen and the local unitary transformation approach by Chen, Gu and Wen provided ways to systematically label non-chiral topological orders in 2D. In those approaches, different topologically ordered many-body wave functions were characterized by different fixed-point tensors. Though extremely powerful, the resulting fixed-point tensors were mathematical abstractions and thus lacked a physical interpretation. As a result it was hard to judge if two different fixed-point tensors described the same quantum phase or not. We want to improve that approach by giving a more physical description of the topological orders. We find that the non-Abelian Berry's phases, - and -matrices, of the topological protected degenerate ground states on a torus give rise to a more physical description of topological orders. Using the Verlinde conjecture, we can even choose the canonical basis for the - and -matrices. It is conjectured that the and -matrices form a complete and one-to-one characterization of non-chiral topological orders and can replace the fixed-point tensor description to give us a more physical label for topological orders. As a result, all the topological properties can be obtained from the - and -matrices, such as number of quasiparticle types (from the dimension of or ), the quasiparticle statistics (from the diagonal elements of ), the quantum dimensions of quasiparticles (from the first row of ), \\etc.",

            "description": "Topological degeneracy is the degeneracy of the ground states in a many-body system in the large-system-size limit. Topological degeneracy cannot be lifted by any local perturbation of the Hamiltonian. The topological degeneracies on closed manifolds have been used to discover/define topological order in many-body systems, which contain excitations with fractional statistics. In this paper, we study a new type of topological degeneracy induced by condensing anyons along a line in two-dimensional topological ordered states. Such topological degeneracy can be viewed as carried by each end of the line defect, which is a generalization of Majorana zero modes. The topological degeneracy can be used as a quantum memory. The ends of line defects carry projective non-Abelian statistics even though they are produced by the condensation of Abelian anyons, and braiding them allows us to perform fault tolerant\u00a0\u2026",

We show that in the high-density limit, despite the infinite degeneracy of the single particle ground states, interaction will select out the Bloch state at the point of the Brillouin zone for boson condensation at the lowest temperature. As the temperature increases, the single-boson superfluid order can be easily destroyed, while an exotic triple-boson paired superfluid order will remain. We establish that this trion superfluid exists in a broad temperature regime until the temperature is increased to the same order of hopping and then the system turns into normal phases. Finally, we show that time-of-flight measurement of the momentum distribution and its\u00a0\u2026",

Here we construct a rotor model that realizes a self-dual Abelian gauge theory. We find that lattice dislocation defects in the model produce topologically protected degeneracy. Even though dislocations are not quasiparticle excitations, they resemble non-Abelian anyons with quantum dimension . Exchanging dislocations can produce topologically protected projective non-Abelian geometric phases. Therefore, we discover a kind of (projective) non-Abelian anyon that appears as the dislocations in an Abelian rotor model. These types of non-Abelian anyons can be viewed as a generalization of the Majorana zero modes.",

This model is known to have a spin-liquid ground state and may potentially be realized in correlated insulators with strong spin -orbit coupling. The effect of hole doping is studied within a - - model, treated using the SU(2) slave boson formalism, which correctly captures the parent spin liquid. We find superconductor ground states with spin triplet pairing that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Interestingly, the pairing is qualitatively different at low and high dopings, and undergoes a first-order transition with doping. At high dopings, it is smoothly connected to a paired state of electrons propagating with the underlying free particle dispersion. However, at low dopings the dispersion is strongly influenced by the magnetic\u00a0\u2026",

The optimally doped sample has a single superconducting gap, but in the overdoped regime a novel pseudogaplike feature emerges. The pseudogaplike phase coexists with superconductivity in the ground state, persists well into the normal state, and shows strong spatial variations.

The model is a combination of the Kitaev honeycomb model and the Heisenberg model with all three nearest-neighbor couplings , , and . A rich phase diagram is obtained at the classical level, including the experimentally suggested zigzag ordered phase; as well as the stripy phase, which extends from the Kitaev-Heisenberg limit to the - - one. Combining the experimentally observed spin order with the optimal fitting to the uniform magnetic susceptibility data gives an estimate of possible parameter values, which in turn reaffirms the necessity of including both the Kitaev and farther neighbor couplings.",

Using neutron scattering and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements to fix the general structure of the local moment and itinerant Fermi pockets, we find a superconducting phase with -wave pairing at the pockets and an incipient sign-change wave near the point, which is adjacent to the insulating phases. The uniform susceptibility and resistivity are found to be consistent with the experiment. The main distinction with iron pnictide superconductors is also discussed.",

The phase diagram obtained at the mean-field level is in qualitative agreement with the experiment, which shows how the magnetic and superconducting (SC) instabilities are driven by the critical coupling between the itinerant/localized electrons. The spin and charge response functions at the random-phase-approximation level further characterize the dynamical evolution of the system. In particular, the dynamic spin susceptibility displays a Goldstone mode in the SDW phase, which evolves into a gapped resonance-like mode in the SC phase.

            "description": "Total reflection occurs when light travels from a medium with refractive index n to an optically less dense medium with refractive index n 0 at an incident angle equal to or greater than the critical angle \u03b8 c= arcsin (n 0\u2215 n)\u2060. Besides being totally reflected, the incoming light penetrates into the less dense medium as an evanescent wave and travels for some distance parallel to the interface before being scattered back to the denser medium. If a third medium of refractive index n (that is, made of the same material as the first medium) is placed at a small distance d (of the same order of magnitude as the light wavelength) to the first medium, the incident light can travel partly through the middle medium into the third medium, and the reflected light in the first medium is weakened. This intriguing phenomenon is termed frustrated total internal reflection. A detailed review of theoretical and experimental studies on frustrated\u00a0\u2026",
