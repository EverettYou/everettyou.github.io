  title: How Focused Are LLMs? A Quantitative Study via Repetitive Deterministic Prediction
    Tasks

  abstract: We investigate the performance of large language models on repetitive
    deterministic prediction tasks and study how the sequence accuracy rate scales
    with output length. Each such task involves repeating the same operation n times.
    Examples include letter replacement in strings following a given rule, integer
    addition, and multiplication of string operators in many body quantum mechanics.
    If the model performs the task through a simple repetition algorithm, the success
    rate should decay exponentially with sequence length. In contrast, our experiments
    on leading large language models reveal a sharp double exponential drop beyond
    a characteristic length scale, forming an accuracy cliff that marks the transition
    from reliable to unstable generation. This indicates that the models fail to execute
    each operation independently. To explain this phenomenon, we propose a statistical
    physics inspired model that captures the competition between external conditioning
    from the prompt and internal interference among generated tokens. The model quantitatively
    reproduces the observed crossover and provides an interpretable link between attention
    induced interference and sequence level failure. Fitting the model to empirical
    results across multiple models and tasks yields effective parameters that characterize
    the intrinsic error rate and error accumulation factor for each model task pair,
    offering a principled framework for understanding the limits of deterministic
    accuracy in large language models.

  abstract: Quantum circuits form a foundational framework in quantum science, enabling
    the description, analysis, and implementation of quantum computations. However,
    designing efficient circuits, typically constructed from single- and two-qubit
    gates, remains a major challenge for specific computational tasks. In this work,
    we introduce a novel artificial intelligence-driven protocol for quantum circuit
    design, benchmarked using shadow tomography for efficient quantum state readout.
    Inspired by techniques from natural language processing (NLP), our approach first
    selects a compact gate dictionary by optimizing the entangling power of two-qubit
    gates. We identify the iSWAP gate as a key element that significantly enhances
    sample efficiency, resulting in a minimal gate set of {I, SWAP, iSWAP}. Building
    on this, we implement a recurrent neural network trained via reinforcement learning
    to generate high-performing quantum circuits. The trained model demonstrates strong
    generalization ability, discovering efficient circuit architectures with low sample
    complexity beyond the training set. Our NLP-inspired framework offers broad potential
    for quantum computation, including extracting properties of logical qubits in
    quantum error correction.

  abstract: Measurements are essential for the processing and protection of information
    in quantum computers. They can also induce long-range entanglement between unmeasured
    qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many non-deterministic
    measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and using the entanglement
    induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new approach for detecting
    such measurement-induced entanglement. We create short-range entangled states
    of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a superconducting quantum processor,
    and aim to characterize the long-range entanglement induced between distant pairs
    of qubits when we measure all of the others. To do this we use unsupervised training
    of neural networks on observations to create computational models for post-measurement
    states and, by correlating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced
    entanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability
    of a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely
    related to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work
    can act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more
    general problems in quantum control.

  abstract: 'We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical
    and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based
    approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving
    purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level.
    We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of
    pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level
    recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent
    to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery,
    we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length
    and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error
    bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations
    of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum
    recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches
    to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information

  abstract: We introduce “dual-unitary shadow tomography''(DUST), a classical shadow
    tomography protocol based on dual-unitary brick-wall circuits. To quantify the
    performance of DUST, we study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in
    one-dimensional qubit systems, evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates
    arranged in a brick-wall structure, ending with a measurement layer. We do this
    by deriving general constraints on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing
    to the case of dual-unitarity. Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in
    these circuits have a rich structure resembling that of relativistic quantum field
    theories, with massless chiral excitations that can decay or fuse into each other,
    which we call left-or right-movers. We develop a mean-field description of the
    Pauli weight in terms of , which represents the probability of having nontrivial
    support at site and depth starting from a fixed weight distribution. We develop
    an equation of state for and simulate it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations.
    For the task of predicting operators with (nearly) full support, we show that
    DUST outperforms brick-wall Clifford shadows of equal depth. This advantage is
    further pronounced for small system sizes and our results are generally robust
    to finite-size effects.

  abstract: Generative models aim to learn the probability distributions underlying
    data, enabling the generation of new, realistic samples. Quantum-inspired generative
    models, such as Born machines based on the matrix product state (MPS) framework,
    have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in unsupervised learning tasks. This
    study advances the Born machine paradigm by introducing trainable token embeddings
    through positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs), replacing the traditional
    approach of static tensor indices. Key technical innovations include encoding
    tokens as quantum measurement operators with trainable parameters and leveraging
    QR decomposition to adjust the physical dimensions of the MPS. This approach maximizes
    the utilization of operator space and enhances the model's expressiveness. Empirical
    results on RNA data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces …

  abstract: In this paper, we construct strange correlators and string order parameters
    for non-invertible symmetry protected topological phases (NISPTs) in 1+1d quantum
    lattice spin models. The strange correlator exhibits long-range order when evaluated
    between two distinct NISPTs and decays exponentially otherwise. We show that strange
    charged operators inserted into the strange correlator are linked to the interface
    algebra (boundary tube algebra) and are non-trivial when all its irreducible representations
    have dimensions greater than one. We discuss the generalization to higher dimensions.
    The string order parameter is obtained by contracting the truncated symmetry operator
    with charge decoration operators, which are determined by the NISPT action tensors.
    We illustrate the above construction using the three NISPTs of and demonstrate
    the extraction of categorical data via tensor networks, particularly through the
    ZX calculus. Finally, we show that the entanglement spectrum degeneracy is determined
    by the irreducible representations of the interface algebra when assuming non-invertible
    symmetry on-site condition.

  abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary
    circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient
    simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping
    the operator evolution to a classical Markov process, we perform Monte Carlo simulations
    to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial
    computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially
    to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally,
    we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,
    and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth,
    governed by the circuit’s gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field
    theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement
    dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational
    framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the
    way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.

  abstract: Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is crucial for
    quantum information processing. Classical shadows enable predicting many properties
    of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single-qubit
    measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight
    Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Introducing a
    shallow random quantum circuit before measurements improves sample efficiency
    for high-weight Pauli observables and low-rank properties. However, in practice,
    these circuits can be noisy and bias the measurement results. Here, we propose
    the robust shallow shadows, which employs Bayesian inference to learn and mitigate
    noise in postprocessing. We analyze noise effects on sample complexity and the
    optimal circuit depth. We provide theoretical guarantees for the success of error

  abstract: Deconfined criticality and gapless topological states have recently attracted
    growing attention, as both phenomena go beyond the traditional Landau paradigm.
    However, the deep connection between these two critical states, particularly in
    lattice realization, remains insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we reveal
    that certain deconfined criticality can be regarded as an intrinsically gapless
    topological state without gapped counterparts in a one dimensional lattice model.
    Using a combination of field-theoretic arguments and large-scale numerical simulations,
    we establish the global phase diagram of the model, which features deconfined
    critical lines separating two distinct spontaneous symmetry breaking ordered phases.
    More importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that the mixed anomaly inherent
    to deconfined criticality enforces topologically robust edge modes near the boundary,
    providing a general mechanism by which deconfined criticality manifests as a gapless
    topological state. Our findings not only offer a new perspective on deconfined
    criticality but also deepen our understanding of gapless topological phases of
    matter.

  abstract: We present a recurrent neural network-based approach for ground state
    preparation utilizing mid-circuit measurement and feedback. Unlike previous methods
    that use machine learning solely as an optimizer, our approach dynamically adjusts
    quantum circuits based on real-time measurement outcomes and learns distinct preparation
    protocols for different Hamiltonians. Notably, our machine learning algorithm
    consistently identifies a state preparation strategy wherein all initial states
    are first steered toward an intermediate state before transitioning to the target
    ground state. We demonstrate that performance systematically improves as a larger
    fraction of ancilla qubits are utilized for measurement and feedback, highlighting
    the efficacy of mid-circuit measurements in state preparation tasks.

  abstract: Multiscale modeling of complex systems is crucial for understanding their
    intricacies. In recent years, data-driven multiscale modeling has emerged as a
    promising approach to tackle challenges associated with complex systems. Still,
    at present,this field is more focused on the prediction or control problems in

    in complex systems, hinting that large-scale complex systems can be modeled at

  abstract: 'We investigate mixed states exhibiting nontrivial topological features,
    focusing on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases under various types of

    information from the SPT ground state despite decoherence. In the''''doubled Hilbert

    examine boundary anomalies in this space. We generalize the concept of the strange
    correlator, initially used to diagnose SPT ground states, to identify anomalies
    in mixed-state density matrices. Through exact calculations of stabilizer Hamiltonians
    and field theory evaluations, we show that nontrivial features of SPT states persist
    in two types of strange correlators: type-I and type-II. The type-I strange correlator
    reveals SPT information that can be efficiently detected and used experimentally,
    such as in preparing long-range entangled states. The type-II strange correlator
    encodes the full topological response of the decohered mixed state, reflecting

  type: preprint

  abstract: Charge conjugation (C), mirror reflection (R), and time reversal (T) symmetries,
    along with internal symmetries, are essential for massless Majorana and Dirac
    fermions. These symmetries are sufficient to rule out potential fermion bilinear
    mass terms, thereby establishing a gapless free fermion fixed point phase, pivotal
    for symmetric mass generation (SMG) transition. In this work, we systematically
    study the anomaly of C-R-T-internal symmetry in all spacetime dimensions by analyzing
    the projective representation (i.e. the fractionalization) of the C-R-T-internal
    symmetry group in the quantum many-body Hilbert space on the lattice. By discovering
    the fermion-flavor-number-dependent C-R-T-internal symmetry's anomaly structure,
    we demonstrate an alternative way to derive the minimal flavor number for SMG,
    which shows consistency with known results from K\"ahler-Dirac fermion or cobordism
    classification. Our findings reveal that, in general spatial dimensions, either
    8 copies of staggered Majorana fermions or 4 copies of staggered Dirac fermions
    admit SMG. By directly searching for 4-fermion interactions that form commuting
    stabilizers respecting all symmetry constraints, we can prove the explicit SMG
    gapping retained a unique ground state in the codespace. Furthermore, we establish
    the correspondence between the symmetry operators of staggered fermions and free
    fermions, which is instrumental in facilitating the analysis of symmetry fractionalization
    at the field theory level.

  abstract: Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits
    a fractionalization distinct from the for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry
    for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby
    forming a group extension of the direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion
    is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when
    the spacetime dimension , the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim ) aligns
    with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim ), rather than being half, which
    necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two
    Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of
    Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in and define the Majorana fermion field
    as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within
    the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups
    across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation
    of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover
    that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct
    from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct
    mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially
    upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to
    elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.

  abstract: The rapid development of quantum technology demands efficient characterization
    of complex quantum many-body states. However, full quantum state tomography requires
    an exponential number of measurements in system size, preventing its practical
    use in large-scale quantum devices. A major recent breakthrough in this direction,
    called classical shadow tomography, significantly reduces the sample complexity,
    the number of samples needed to estimate properties of a state, by implementing
    random Clifford rotations before measurements. Despite many recent efforts, reducing
    the sample complexity below for extracting any non-successive local operators
    with a size remains a challenge. In this work, we achieve a significantly smaller
    sample complexity of using a protocol that hybridizes locally random and globally
    deterministic unitary operations. The key insight is the discovery of a deterministic
    global unitary, termed as \textit{contractive unitary}, which is more efficient
    in reducing the operator size to enhance tomography efficiency. The contractive
    unitary perfectly matches the advantages of the atom array quantum computation
    platform and is readily realized in the atom array quantum processor. More importantly,
    it highlights a new strategy in classical shadow tomography, demonstrating that
    a random-deterministic hybridized protocol can be more efficient than fully random
    measurements.

  abstract: In this paper, we study the twisted gauging on the (1+ 1) d lattice and
    construct various non-local mappings on the lattice operators. To be specific,
    we define the twisted Gauss law operator and implement the twisted gauging of
    the finite group on the lattice motivated by the orbifolding procedure in the
    conformal field theory, which involves the data of non-trivial element in the
    second cohomology group of the gauge group. We show the twisted gauging is equivalent
    to the two-step procedure of first applying the SPT entangler and then untwisted
    gauging. We use the twisted gauging to construct the triality (order 3) and -ality
    (order ) mapping on the symmetric Hamiltonians, where is a prime. Such novel non-local
    mappings generalize Kramers-Wannier duality and they preserve the locality of
    symmetric operators but map charged operators to non-local ones. We further construct
    quantum process to realize these non-local mappings and analyze the induced mappings
    on the phase diagrams. For theories that are invariant under these non-local mappings,
    they admit the corresponding non-invertible symmetries. The non-invertible symmetry
    will constrain the theory at the multicritical point between the gapped phases.
    We further give the condition when the non-invertible symmetry can have symmetric
    gapped phase with a unique ground state.

    The model is a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) trained on simulated classical
    shadow data of ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, obtained through randomized
    Pauli measurements. Once trained, the model can predict a range of ground state
    properties across the Hamiltonian parameter space. We demonstrate its effectiveness
    on the transverse-field Ising model and the cluster-Ising model, accurately predicting
    ground state energy, correlation functions, and entanglement entropy. This approach
    highlights the potential of combining quantum data with classical machine learning

  abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in offers a
    fresh platform for exploring unconventional pairing mechanisms. Starting with
    the basic argument that the electrons in orbitals nearly form local moments, we

    stems from a kinetic-energy-driven mechanism. Specifically, a Berry phase will

  abstract: Diffusion models have played a crucial role in the recent advancements
    in generative image modeling. These models are characterized by a forward process
    that incrementally corrupts images. The modeling objective is to develop a reverse

    In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion process that operates in the frequency
    domain. Typically, the frequency domain representation of an image exhibits a
    sparse structure, with energy predominantly concentrated in low frequency components.
    This inherent sparsity aids us in the effective separation of signal and noise
    during the reverse process. We utilize this property to introduce a scale-dependent
    noise schedule, offering precise control over various image scales. Working in

  abstract: Symmetric mass generation (SMG) insulators are interaction-driven, featureless
    Mott insulating states in quantum many-body fermionic systems. Recent advancements
    suggest that zeros in the fermion Green's function could lead to non-vanishing
    negative optical conductivity in SMG insulators, even below the charge excitation
    gap. This study explores the origin of this unusual behavior through the lens
    of pole-zero duality, highlighting a critical issue where the current operator
    becomes unbounded, rendering the response function unphysical. By employing a
    lattice model, we derive a well-behaved lattice regularization of the current
    operator, enabling a detailed study of optical conductivity in SMG insulators.
    Utilizing both analytical and numerical methods, including strong-coupling expansions,
    we confirm that SMG insulators exhibit no optical conductivity at low energies
    below the charge gap, effectively resolving the paradox. This work not only deepens
    our understanding of quantum many-body phenomena but also lays a robust theoretical
    groundwork for future experimental explorations of SMG materials.

  abstract: The “symmetric mass generation” (SMG) quantum phase transition discovered
    in recent years has attracted great interest from both condensed matter and high
    energy theory communities. Here, interacting Dirac fermions acquire a gap without
    condensing any fermion bilinear mass term or any concomitant spontaneous symmetry
    breaking. It is hence beyond the conventional Gross-Neveu-Yukawa-Higgs paradigm.
    One important question we address in this Letter is whether the SMG transition
    corresponds to a true unitary conformal field theory. We employ the sharp diagnosis
    including the scaling of disorder operator and Rényi entanglement entropy in large-scale
    lattice model quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results strongly suggest that
    the SMG transition is indeed an unconventional quantum phase transition and it
    should correspond to a true unitary conformal field theory.

  abstract: We introduce a classical shadow tomography scheme based on dual-unitary
    brick-wall circuits termed "dual-unitary shadow tomography" (DUST). For this we
    study operator spreading and Pauli weight dynamics in one-dimensional qubit systems,
    evolved by random two-local dual-unitary gates arranged in a brick-wall structure,
    ending with a final measurement layer. We do this by deriving general constraints
    on the Pauli weight transfer matrix and specializing to the case of dual-unitarity.
    We first show that dual-unitaries must have a minimal amount of entropy production.
    Remarkably, we find that operator spreading in these circuits have a rich structure
    resembling that of relativistic quantum field theories, with massless chiral excitations
    that can decay or fuse into each other, which we call left- or right-movers. We
    develop a mean-field description of the Pauli weight in terms of , which represents
    the probability of having nontrivial support at site and depth starting from a
    fixed weight distribution. We develop an equation of state for , and simulate
    it numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, we demonstrate that the
    fast-thermalizing properties of dual-unitary circuits make them better at predicting
    large operators than shallow brick-wall Clifford circuits. Our results are robust
    to finite-size effects due to the chirality of dual-unitary brick-wall circuits.

  abstract: We develop a strong coupling approach towards quantum magnetism in Mott
    insulators for Wannier-obstructed bands. Despite the lack of Wannier orbitals,
    electrons can still singly occupy a set of exponentially localized but nonorthogonal
    orbitals to minimize the repulsive interaction energy. We develop a systematic
    method to establish an effective spin model from the electron Hamiltonian using
    a diagrammatic approach. The nonorthogonality of the Mott basis gives rise to
    multiple new channels of spin-exchange (or permutation) interactions beyond Hartree–Fock
    and superexchange terms. We apply this approach to a Kagome lattice model of interacting
    electrons in Wannier-obstructed bands (including both Chern bands and fragile
    topological bands). Due to the orbital nonorthogonality, as parameterized by the
    nearest-neighbor orbital overlap g , this model exhibits stable ferromagnetism
    up to a finite bandwidth W∼Ug, where U is the interaction strength. This provides
    an explanation for the experimentally observed robust ferromagnetism in Wannier-obstructed
    bands. The effective spin model constructed through our approach also opens up
    the possibility for frustrated quantum magnetism around the ferromagnet-antiferromagnet
    crossover in Wannier-obstructed bands.

  abstract: We propose that the Fermi surface anomaly of symmetry group in any dimension

    space). Given the noncommutative nature of the phase-space coordinates, we show
    that the momentum space dimensions should be counted as negative dimensions for
    SPT classification purposes. Therefore, the classification of phase-space Chern
    insulators (or, more generally fermionic SPT phases) always reduces to a -dimensional
    problem, which can then be answered by the cobordism approach. In addition to

  abstract: The symmetric mass generation (SMG) phase is an insulator in which a single-particle
    gap is intrinsically opened by the interaction, without involving symmetry spontaneously
    breaking or topological order. Here, we perform unbiased quantum Monte-Carlo simulation
    and systematically investigate a bilayer fermionic model hosting Fermi surface
    SMG in the strongly interacting regime. With increasing interaction strength,
    the model undergoes a quantum phase transition from an exciton insulator to an
    SMG phase, belonging to the (2+1)-dimensional O(4) universality class. We access
    the spectral properties of the SMG phase, resembling a Mott insulating phase with
    relatively flat dispersion and pronounced spectral broadening. The dispersion
    of Green's function zeros is extracted from spectral function, featuring a surface
    at zero frequency precisely located at the original non-interacting Fermi surface,
    which constitutes a hallmark of the Fermi surface SMG phase. The bilayer model

  abstract: The Fermi surface symmetric mass generation (SMG) is an intrinsically
    interaction-driven mechanism that opens an excitation gap on the Fermi surface
    without invoking symmetry-breaking or topological order. We explore this phenomenon
    within a bilayer square lattice model of spin-1/2 fermions, where the system can
    be tuned from a metallic Fermi liquid phase to a strongly interacting SMG insulator
    phase by an interlayer spin-spin interaction. The SMG insulator preserves all
    symmetries and has no mean-field interpretation at the single-particle level.
    It is characterized by zeros in the fermion Green's function, which encapsulate
    the same Fermi volume in momentum space as the original Fermi surface, a feature
    mandated by the Luttinger theorem. Utilizing both numerical and field-theoretical
    methods, we provide compelling evidence for these Green's function zeros across
    both strong and weak coupling regimes of …

  abstract: We develop a machine-learning renormalization group (MLRG) algorithm to
    explore and analyze many-body lattice models in statistical physics. Using the
    representation learning capability of generative modeling, MLRG automatically

    spin configurations and formulates RG equations without human supervision. The
    algorithm does not focus on simulating any particular lattice model but broadly
    explores all possible models compatible with the internal and lattice symmetries
    given the on-site symmetry representation. It can uncover the RG monotone that
    governs the RG flow, assuming a strong form of the c-theorem. This enables several
    downstream tasks, including unsupervised classification of phases, automatic location
    of phase transitions or critical points, controlled estimation of critical exponents,

  abstract: The Kähler-Dirac fermion, recognized as an elegant geometric approach,
    offers an alternative to traditional representations of relativistic fermions.
    Recent studies have demonstrated that symmetric mass generation (SMG) can precisely
    occur with two copies of Kähler-Dirac fermions across any space-time dimensions.
    This conclusion stems from the study of anomaly cancellation within the fermion
    system. Our research provides an alternative understanding of this phenomenon
    from a condensed matter perspective, by associating the interacting Kähler-Dirac
    fermion with the boundary of bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases.
    We show that the low-energy bosonic fluctuations in a single copy of the Kähler-Dirac
    fermion can be mapped to the boundary modes of a -classified bosonic SPT state,
    protected by an inversion symmetry universally across all dimensions. This implies
    that two copies of …

  abstract: We investigate a bilayer honeycomb lattice model of spin-1/2 fermions
    at half-filling with local Heisenberg coupling of fermion spins across the two
    layers. Using variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation, we demonstrate that the
    system undergoes a direct transition from a Dirac semimetal phase to a symmetric
    gapped phase, known as symmetric mass generation (SMG), as the Heisenberg coupling
    strength is increased. The transition does not involve spontaneous symmetry breaking
    or topological order and has been proposed as an example of the fermionic deconfined
    quantum critical point (fDQCP). Our simulation shows that a fermionic parton bilinear
    mass opens at the transition point while all symmetries are still preserved thanks
    to the quantum fluctuations introduced by the correlation factor in the variational
    wave function. From the simulation data, we extract the critical exponent and

    to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly cancellation in bilayer spin-1/2 lattice
    systems. Through a single-orbital bilayer square lattice model involving intralayer
    hopping and interlayer superexchange interaction , we demonstrate the emergence
    of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) upon doping the SMG insulator. The
    SC phase features -wave interlayer spin-singlet pairing and exhibits a crossover

  abstract: The output distribution of a neural network (NN) over the entire input
    space captures the complete input-output mapping relationship, offering in-sights
    toward a more comprehensive NN under-standing. Exhaustive enumeration or traditional
    Monte Carlo methods for the entire input space can exhibit impractical sampling
    time, especially for high-dimensional inputs. To make such difficult sampling
    computationally feasible, in this paper, we propose a novel Gradient-based Wang-Landau
    (GWL) sampler. We first draw the connection between the output distribution of
    a NN and the density of states (DOS) of a physical system. Then, we renovate the
    classic sampler for the DOS problem, Wang-Landau algorithm, by re-placing its
    random proposals with gradient-based Monte Carlo proposals. This way, our GWL
    sampler investigates the under-explored subsets of the input space much more efficiently.
    Extensive experiments have verified the accuracy of the output distribution generated
    by GWL and also showcased several interesting findings-for example, in a binary
    image classification task, both CNN and ResNet mapped the majority of human unrecognizable
    images to very negative logit values.

  abstract: 'Classical shadow tomography is a powerful randomized measurement protocol
    for predicting many properties of a quantum state with few measurements. Two classical
    shadow protocols have been extensively studied in the literature: the single-qubit
    (local) Pauli measurement, which is well suited for predicting local operators
    but inefficient for large operators; and the global Clifford measurement, which
    is efficient for low-rank operators but infeasible on near-term quantum devices
    due to the extensive gate overhead. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable classical
    shadow tomography approach for generic randomized measurements implemented with
    finite-depth local Clifford random unitary circuits, which interpolates between
    the limits of Pauli and Clifford measurements. The method combines the recently
    proposed locally-scrambled classical shadow tomography framework with tensor network
    techniques to achieve scalability for computing the classical shadow reconstruction
    map and evaluating various physical properties. The method enables classical shadow
    tomography to be performed on shallow quantum circuits with superior sample efficiency
    and minimal gate overhead and is friendly to noisy intermediate-scale quantum
    (NISQ) devices. We show that the shallow-circuit measurement protocol provides
    immediate, exponential advantages over the Pauli measurement protocol for predicting
    quasi-local operators. It also enables a more efficient fidelity estimation compared
    to the Pauli measurement.'

    a mass gap by nonperturbative interactions without generating any fermion bilinear
    condensation. The previous studies of SMG have been limited to Dirac/Weyl/Majorana
    fermions with zero Fermi volume in the free fermion limit. In this paper, we generalize
    the concept of SMG to Fermi liquid (FL) with a finite Fermi volume and discuss
    how to gap out the Fermi surfaces (FSs) by interactions without breaking the U(1)
    loop group symmetry or developing topological orders. We provide examples of FS
    SMG in both -dimensional and -dimensional FL systems when several FSs together
    cancel the FS anomaly. However, the U(1) loop group symmetry in these cases is
    still restrictive enough to rule out all possible fermion bilinear gapping terms,
    such that a nonperturbative interaction mechanism is the only way to gap out the

    one of which the presence of surface Fermi-arc states that is topologically protected.
    The number of such states can be computed by the Chern numbers at different momentum
    slices, which fluctuates with changing momentum and depends on the distribution
    of Weyl points in the Brillouin zone. For realistic systems, it may be difficult
    to locate the momenta at which these Weyl points and Fermi-arc states appear.
    Therefore, we extend the analysis of a parametric random matrix model proposed
    by Walker and Wilkinson to find the statistics of their distributions. Our numerical
    data shows that Weyl points with opposite polarities are short range correlated,
    and the Chern number fluctuation only grows linearly for a limited momentum difference
    before it saturates. We also find that the saturation value scales with the total
    number of bands. We then compute the short-range correlation length from perturbation
    theory, and derive the dependence of the Chern number fluctuation on the momentum
    difference, showing that the saturation results from the short-range correlation.

  abstract: The most well-known mechanism for fermions to acquire a mass is the Nambu–Goldstone–Anderson–Higgs
    mechanism, i.e., after a spontaneous symmetry breaking, a bosonic field that couples
    to the fermion mass term condenses, which grants a mass gap for the fermionic
    excitation. In the last few years, it was gradually understood that there is a
    new mechanism of mass generation for fermions without involving any symmetry breaking
    within an anomaly-free symmetry group, also applicable to chiral fermions with
    anomaly-free chiral symmetries. This new mechanism is generally referred to as
    the symmetric mass generation (SMG). It is realized that the SMG has deep connections
    with interacting topological insulator/superconductors, symmetry-protected topological
    states, perturbative local and non-perturbative global anomaly cancellations,
    and deconfined quantum criticality. It has strong implications for the lattice
    regularization of chiral gauge theories. This article defines the SMG, summarizes
    the current numerical results, introduces an unifying theoretical framework (including
    the parton-Higgs and the s-confinement mechanisms, as well as the symmetry-extension
    construction), and presents an overview of various features and applications of
    SMG.

  abstract: We introduce a technique to estimate error-mitigated expectation values
    on noisy quantum computers. Our technique performs shadow tomography on a logical
    state to produce a memory-efficient classical reconstruction of the noisy density
    matrix. Using efficient classical post-processing, one can mitigate errors by
    projecting a general nonlinear function of the noisy density matrix into the codespace.
    The subspace expansion and virtual distillation can be viewed as special cases
    of the new framekwork. We show our method is favorable in the quantum and classical
    resources overhead. Relative to subspace expansion which requires samples to estimate
    a logical Pauli observable with error correction code, our technique requires
    only samples. Relative to virtual distillation, our technique can compute powers
    of the density matrix without additional copies of quantum states or quantum memory.
    We present numerical evidence using logical states encoded with up to sixty physical
    qubits and show fast convergence to error-free expectation values with only samples
    under 1% depolarizing noise.

  abstract: Coherence delocalization has been investigated on a coupled‐cavity molecular
    polariton platform in time, frequency, and spatial domains, enabled by ultrafast
    two‐dimensional infrared hyperspectral imaging. Unidirectional coherence delocalization
    (coherence prepared in one cavity transferred to another cavity) has been observed
    in frequency and real space. This directionality is enabled by the dissipation
    of delocalized photon from high‐energy to low‐energy modes, described by Lindblad
    dynamics. Further experiments show that when coherences are directly prepared
    between polaritons from different cavities, only energetically nearby polaritons
    can form coherences that survive the long‐range environmental fluctuation. Together
    with the Lindblad dynamics, this result implies that coherences delocalize through
    a one‐step mechanism where photons transfer from one cavity to another, shedding

  abstract: Classical shadow tomography provides an efficient method for predicting
    functions of an unknown quantum state from a few measurements of the state. It
    relies on a unitary channel that efficiently scrambles the quantum information
    of the state to the measurement basis. Facing the challenge of realizing deep
    unitary circuits on near-term quantum devices, we explore the scenario in which
    the unitary channel can be shallow and is generated by a quantum chaotic Hamiltonian
    via time evolution. We provide an unbiased estimator of the density matrix for
    all ranges of the evolution time. We analyze the sample complexity of the Hamiltonian-driven
    shadow tomography. For Pauli observables, we find that it can be more efficient
    than the unitary-2-design-based shadow tomography in a sequence of intermediate
    time windows that range from an order-1 scrambling time to a timescale of , given

    mutual information between far-separated disjoint regions, which does not hold

    a statistical gravity model consisting of a massive scalar field on a fluctuating
    background geometry. We propose a machine-learning algorithm that recovers the
    underlying geometry fluctuation from multi-region entanglement entropy data by
    modeling the bulk geometry distribution via a generative neural network. To demonstrate
    its effectiveness, we tested the model on a free fermion system and showed mutual

  abstract: Duality places an important constraint on the renormalization group flows

    as a symmetry, this leads to the multicriticalities. This work investigates a

  abstract: We present a formulation for investigating quench dynamics across quantum
    phase transitions in the presence of decoherence. We formulate decoherent dynamics
    induced by continuous quantum non-demolition measurements of the instantaneous
    Hamiltonian. We generalize the well-studied universal Kibble-Zurek behavior for
    linear temporal drive across the critical point. We identify a strong decoherence
    regime wherein the decoherence time is shorter than the standard correlation time,
    which varies as the inverse gap above the groundstate. In this regime, we find
    that the freeze-out time for when the system falls out of equilibrium and the
    associated freeze-out length show power-law scaling with respect to the quench
    rate , where the exponents depend on the correlation length exponent and the dynamical
    exponent associated with the transition. The universal exponents differ from those
    of standard Kibble-Zurek scaling. We explicitly demonstrate this scaling behavior
    in the instance of a topological transition in a Chern insulator system. We show
    that the freeze-out time scale can be probed from the relaxation of the Hall conductivity.
    Furthermore, on introducing disorder to break translational invariance, we demonstrate
    how quenching results in regions of imbalanced excitation density characterized
    by an emergent length scale which also shows universal scaling. We perform numerical
    simulations to confirm our analytical predictions and corroborate the scaling
    arguments that we postulate as universal to a host of systems.

  abstract: The neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) is a novel machine
    learning architecture whose weights are smooth functions of the continuous depth.
    We apply the neural ODE to holographic QCD by regarding the weight functions as
    a bulk metric, and train the machine with lattice QCD data of chiral condensate
    at finite temperature. The machine finds consistent bulk geometry at various values
    of temperature and discovers the emergent black hole horizon in the holographic
    bulk automatically. The holographic Wilson loops calculated with the emergent
    machine-learned bulk spacetime have consistent temperature dependence of confinement
    and Debye-screening behavior. In machine learning models with physically interpretable
    weights, the neural ODE frees us from discretization artifact leading to difficult
    ingenuity of hyperparameters, and improves numerical accuracy to make the model
    more trustworthy.

  abstract: Random measurements have been shown to induce a phase transition in an
    extended quantum system evolving under chaotic unitary dynamics, when the strength
    of measurements exceeds a threshold value. Below this threshold, a steady state
    with a subthermal volume law entanglement emerges, which is resistant to the disentangling
    action of measurements, suggesting a connection to quantum error-correcting codes.
    We quantify these notions by identifying a power-law decay of the mutual information
    in the volume-law-entangled phase, between a qudit located a distance from the
    boundary of a region , and the complement , which implies that a measurement of
    this qudit will retrieve very little information about . We also find a universal
    logarithmic contribution to the volume law entanglement entropy which is intimately

    fluctuations. In this way, the neural network develops the optimal renormalization-group
    transformations. Using the machine-designed EHM to map the CFT back to a bulk

  abstract: We study a possible deconfined quantum phase transition in a realistic
    model of a two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland quantum magnet, using both numerical
    and field theoretic techniques. Using the infinite density matrix renormalization
    group (IDMRG) method, we verify the existence of an intermediate plaquette valence
    bond solid (PVBS) order, with twofold degeneracy, between the dimer and Néel ordered
    phases. We argue that the quantum phase transition between the Néel and PVBS orders
    may be described by a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) with an emergent
    O(4) symmetry . By analyzing the correlation length spectrum obtained from IDMRG,
    we provide evidence for the DQCP and emergent O(4) symmetry in the lattice model.

  abstract: We introduce a class of phase transitions separating quantum states with
    different entanglement features. An example of such an “entanglement phase transition”
    is provided by the many-body localization transition in disordered quantum systems,
    as it separates highly entangled thermal states at weak disorder from many-body
    localized states with low entanglement at strong disorder. In the spirit of random
    matrix theory, we describe a simple model for such transitions where a physical
    quantum many-body system lives at the “holographic” boundary of a bulk random
    tensor network. Using a replica trick approach, we map the calculation of the
    entanglement properties of the boundary system onto the free energy cost of fluctuating
    domain walls in a classical statistical mechanics model. This allows us to interpret
    transitions between volume-law and area-law scaling of entanglement as ordering

    to predict the observation data of physical systems? As a benchmark and a proof-of-principle
    study of this possibility, here we show an introspective learning architecture
    that can automatically develop the concept of the quantum wave function and discover

    mappings of a quantum particle. This introspective learning architecture contains
    a machine translator to perform the potential to density mapping, and a knowledge

    from the hidden states of the translator, which turns out to be the quantum wave

  abstract: The deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) was originally proposed as
    a continuous transition between two spontaneous symmetry breaking phases in 2D
    spin-1/2 systems. While great efforts have been spent on the DQCP for 2D systems,
    both theoretically and numerically, ambiguities among the nature of the transition
    are still not completely clarified. Here we shift the focus to a recently proposed
    1D incarnation of DQCP in a spin-1/2 chain. By solving it with the variational
    matrix product state in the thermodynamic limit, a continuous transition between
    a valence-bond solid phase and a ferromagnetic phase is discovered. The scaling
    dimensions of various operators are calculated and compared with those from field
    theoretical description. At the critical point, two emergent symmetries are revealed,
    and the associated conserved current operators with exact integer scaling dimensions

    We construct the Euclidean space-time lattice path integral for a theory with
    strongly interacting vector bosons and Majorana fermions coupled to an gauge field
    and derive an exact duality between this theory and the theory of a free Majorana
    fermion on the space-time lattice. We argue that this lattice duality implies
    the desired infrared duality between the field theory with an vector critical
    boson coupled to an Chern-Simons gauge theory, and a free massless Majorana fermion
    in 2+1D. We also generalize the lattice construction of dualities to models with

  abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model incorporates rich physics, ranging from
    exotic non-Fermi liquid states without quasiparticle excitations, to holographic
    duality and quantum chaos. However, its experimental realization remains a daunting
    challenge due to various unnatural ingredients of the SYK Hamiltonian such as
    its strong randomness and fully nonlocal fermion interaction. At present, constructing
    such a nonlocal Hamiltonian and exploring its dynamics is best through digital
    quantum simulation, where state-of-the-art techniques can already handle a moderate
    number of qubits. Here, we demonstrate a first step towards simulation of the
    SYK model on a nuclear-spin-chain simulator. We observed the fermion paring instability
    of the non-Fermi liquid state and the chaotic-nonchaotic transition at simulated
    temperatures, as was predicted by previous theories. As the realization of the

  abstract: Noether’s theorem is one of the fundamental laws of physics, relating
    continuous symmetries and conserved currents. Here we explore the role of Noether’s
    theorem at the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), which is a quantum phase
    transition beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. It was expected that a
    larger continuous symmetry could emerge at the DQCP, which, if true, should lead
    to conserved current at low energy. By identifying the emergent current fluctuation
    in the spin excitation spectra, we can quantitatively study the current-current
    correlation in large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results reveal
    the conservation of the emergent current, as signified by the vanishing anomalous
    dimension of the current operator, and hence provide supporting evidence for the
    emergent symmetry at the DQCP. Our study demonstrates an elegant yet practical

  abstract: The recent discovery of the Mott insulating and superconducting phases
    in twisted bilayer graphene has generated tremendous research interest. Here,
    we develop a weak coupling approach to the superconductivity in twisted bilayer
    graphene, starting from the Fermi liquid regime. A key observation is that near
    half filling, the fermiology consists of well nested Fermi pockets derived from
    opposite valleys, leading to enhanced valley fluctuation, which in turn can mediate
    superconductivity. This scenario is studied within the random phase approximation.
    We find that inter-valley electron pairing with either chiral ( d + i d mixed
    with p −i p ) or helical form factor is the dominant instability. An approximate
    SO(4) spin-valley symmetry implies a near degeneracy of spin-singlet and triplet
    pairing. On increasing interactions, commensurate inter-valley coherence wave

    to construct the optimal RTN that best reproduce the entanglement feature. The

  abstract: Massless Dirac fermions arise in a variety of systems from graphene to
    the surfaces of topological insulators, where generating a mass is typically associated
    with breaking a symmetry. However, with strong interactions, a symmetric gapped
    phase can arise for multiples of eight Dirac fermions. A continuous quantum phase
    transition from the massless Dirac phase to this massive phase, which we term
    symmetric mass generation, is necessarily beyond the Landau paradigm and is hard
    to describe even at the conceptual level. Nevertheless, such transition has been
    consistently observed in several numerical studies recently. Here, we propose
    a theory for the symmetric mass generation transition which is reminiscent of
    deconfined criticality and involves emergent non-Abelian gauge fields coupled
    both to Dirac fermions and to critical Higgs bosons. We motivate the theory using
    an explicit parton construction …

  abstract: Recent proposal of the duality between the noncompact QED and the easy-plane
    noncompact CP (NCCP ) model suggests that the deconfined quantum critical point
    (dQCP) between the easy-plane antiferromagnet and the VBS order on the square
    lattice may have an emergent O(4) symmetry, due to the self-duality of the noncompact
    QED . Recent numerical progresses suggest that this easy-plane dQCP does exist
    and it has an emergent O(4) symmetry. But for the O(4) symmetry to really emerge
    at the dQCP, certain O(4) symmetry breaking perturbations need to be irrelevant
    at the putative O(4) fixed point. It is more convenient to study these symmetry
    breaking perturbations in the noncompact QED . We demonstrate that a natural large-
    generalization and a controlled expansion supports the stability of the O(4) fixed
    point against the symmetry breaking perturbations. We also develop the theory
    for two tricritical points close to the easy-plane dQCP. One tricritical point
    is between the dQCP and a {\it self-dual} topological order; the other is the
    tricritical point that connects the continuous dQCP and a first order N\'{e}el-VBS
    transition, motivated by recent numerical results.

  abstract: Random tensor networks provide useful models that incorporate various
    important features of holographic duality. A tensor network is usually defined
    for a fixed graph geometry specified by the connection of tensors. In this paper,
    we generalize the random tensor network approach to allow quantum superposition

    spatial geometries, characterized by weighted adjacient matrices of all possible
    graphs, are mapped to the boundary Hilbert space and form an overcomplete basis
    of the boundary. We name such an overcomplete basis as holographic coherent states.
    A generic boundary state can be expanded in this basis, which describes the state
    as a superposition of different spatial geometries in the bulk. We discuss how
    to define distinct classical geometries and small fluctuations around them. We

  abstract: 'Recently, significant progress has been made in ( )-dimensional conformal
    field theories without supersymmetry. In particular, it was realized that different
    Lagrangians may be related by hidden dualities; i.e., seemingly different field
    theories may actually be identical in the infrared limit. Among all the proposed
    dualities, one has attracted particular interest in the field of strongly correlated
    quantum-matter systems: the one relating the easy-plane noncompact model ( ) and
    noncompact quantum electrodynamics (QED) with two flavors ( ) of massless two-component
    Dirac fermions. The easy-plane model is the field theory of the putative deconfined
    quantum-critical point separating a planar ( ) antiferromagnet and a dimerized
    (valence-bond solid) ground state, while noncompact QED is the theory for the
    transition between a bosonic symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial
    Mott insulator. In this work …'

  abstract: We study a series of perturbations on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.
    We show that the maximal chaotic non-Fermi-liquid phase described by the ordinary
    SYK model has marginally relevant or irrelevant (depending on the sign of the
    coupling constants) four-fermion perturbations allowed by symmetry. Changing the
    sign of one of these four-fermion perturbations leads to a continuous chaotic-nonchaotic
    quantum phase transition of the system accompanied by a spontaneous time-reversal
    symmetry breaking. Starting with the model with a -fermion interaction, similar
    perturbations can lead to a series of new fixed points with continuously varying
    exponents.

  abstract: Bosonic symmetry protected topological (BSPT) states, the bosonic analogue
    of topological insulators, have attracted enormous theoretical interest in the
    last few years. Although BSPT states have been classified by various approaches,
    there is so far no successful experimental realization of any BSPT state in two
    or higher dimensions. In this paper, we propose that a two-dimensional BSPT state
    with symmetry can be realized in bilayer graphene in a magnetic field. Here the
    two symmetries represent total spin and total charge conservation, respectively.
    The Coulomb interaction plays a central role in this proposal—it gaps out all
    the fermions at the boundary, so that only bosonic charge and spin degrees of
    freedom are gapless and protected at the edge. Based on the above conclusion,
    we propose that the bulk quantum phase transition between the BSPT and trivial
    phase, which can be driven by …

  abstract: We consider the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model as a model for the thermalized
    zero-dimensional boundary of a many-body localized, fermionic symmetry protected
    topological (SPT) phase in one spatial dimension. The fermions at the boundary
    are always fully interacting. We find that the boundary is thermalized and investigate
    how its boundary anomaly, dictated by the bulk SPT order, is encoded in the quantum
    chaotic eigenspectrum of the SYK model. We show that depending on the SPT symmetry
    class, the boundary many-body level statistics cycle in a systematic manner through
    those of the three different Wigner-Dyson random matrix ensembles with a periodicity
    in the topological index that matches the interaction-reduced classification of
    the bulk SPT states. We consider all three symmetry classes BDI, AIII, and CII,

  abstract: We study a lattice model of interacting Dirac fermions in dimensions space-time
    with an SU(4) symmetry. While increasing the interaction strength, this model
    undergoes a continuous quantum phase transition from a weakly interacting Dirac
    semimetal to a fully gapped and nondegenerate phase without condensing any Dirac
    fermion bilinear mass operator. This unusual mechanism for mass generation is
    consistent with recent studies of interacting topological insulators/superconductors,

  abstract: Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases in free fermion and interacting
    bosonic systems have been classified, but the physical phenomena of interacting
    fermionic SPT phases have not been fully explored. Here, employing large-scale
    quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the edge physics of a bilayer Kane-Mele-Hubbard
    model with zigzag ribbon geometry. Our unbiased numerical results show that the
    fermion edge modes are gapped out by interaction, while the bosonic edge modes
    remain gapless at the boundary, before the bulk quantum phase transition to a
    topologically trivial phase. Therefore, finite fermion gaps both in the bulk and
    on the edge, together with the robust gapless bosonic edge modes, prove that our
    system becomes an emergent bosonic SPT phase at low energy, which is directly
    observed in an interacting fermion lattice model.

  abstract: We investigate the generic features of the low energy dynamical spin structure
    factor of the Kitaev honeycomb quantum spin liquid perturbed away from its exact
    soluble limit by generic symmetry-allowed exchange couplings. We find that the
    spin gap persists in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, but generally vanishes provided
    more generic symmetry-allowed interactions exist. We formulate the generic expansion
    of the spin operator in terms of fractionalized Majorana fermion operators according
    to the symmetry enriched topological order of the Kitaev spin liquid, described
    by its projective symmetry group. The dynamical spin structure factor displays
    power-law scaling bounded by Dirac cones in the vicinity of the , , and points
    of the Brillouin zone, rather than the spin gap found for the exactly soluble

    eight copies of 3D time-reversal invariant topological superconductors (TSC) on

    the fermion and afterwards turns the system into a 3D boson topological liquid

  abstract: For a gapped disordered many-body system with both internal and translation

    state representations for all eigenstates. The method is applicable to many interacting

  abstract: It is well-known that a stable algebraic spin liquid state (or equivalently
    an algebraic Bose liquid (ABL) state) with emergent gapless photon excitations
    can exist in quantum spin ice systems, or in a quantum dimer model on a bipartite
    lattice. This photon phase is stable against any weak perturbation without assuming
    any symmetry. Further works concluded that certain lattice models give rise to
    more exotic stable algebraic Bose liquid phases with graviton-like excitations.
    In this paper we will show how these algebraic Bose liquid states can be generalized
    to stable phases with even more exotic types of gapless excitations and then argue
    that these new phases are stable against weak perturbations. We also explicitly
    show that these theories have an (algebraic) topological ground state degeneracy
    on a torus, and construct the corresponding topological invariants.

    states of a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator, we propose one possible
    two-dimensional boundary state of a 3D bosonic symmetry protected topological

  abstract: Distinguishing the nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase
    from the trivial insulator phase in the presence of electron-electron interaction
    is an urgent question to the study of topological insulators, due to the fact
    that most of the topological indices defined for free electron systems are very

    strange correlator is a sensitive diagnosis to detect SPT states in interacting
    systems. Employing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we investigate
    the interaction-driven quantum phase transition in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model.
    The transition from the quantum spin Hall insulator at weak interaction to an
    antiferromagnetic Mott insulator at strong interaction can be readily detected
    by the momentum space behavior of the strange correlator in single-particle, spin,
    and pairing sectors. The interaction effects on the symmetry …

  abstract: 'By definition, the physics of the -dimensional (dim) boundary of a -dim
    symmetry protected topological (SPT) state cannot be realized as itself on a -dim

    We argue (conjecture) that if the gauge anomaly of the boundary is “perturbative,”

  abstract: 'We address the following question: Which kinds of symmetry protected
    topological (SPT) Hamiltonians can be many-body localized? That is, which Hamiltonians
    with an SPT ground state have finite energy density excited states which are all
    localized by disorder? Based on the observation that a finite energy density state,
    if localized, can be viewed as the ground state of a local Hamiltonian, we propose
    a simple (though possibly incomplete) rule for many-body localization of SPT Hamiltonians:
    If the ground state and top state (highest energy state) belong to the same SPT
    phase, then it is possible to localize all the finite energy density states; If
    the ground and top state belong to different SPT phases, then most likely there
    are some finite energy density states which can not be fully localized. We will
    give concrete examples of both scenarios. In some of these examples, we argue
    that interaction can actually "assist" localization of finite energy density states,
    which is counter-intuitive to what is usually expected.'

    phase transitions. The first is a quantum phase transition between the weakly
    interacting gapless Dirac fermion phase and a strongly interacting fully gapped
    and symmetric trivial phase, which cannot be described by the standard Gross-Neveu
    model. The second is a quantum critical point between a quantum spin Hall insulator
    with spin conservation and the previously mentioned strongly interacting fully
    gapped phase. At the latter quantum critical point the single-particle excitations
    remain gapped, while spin and charge gaps both close. We argue that the first

    a SPT state as whether it is separated from the trivial state through a bulk phase
    transition, which is a general definition applicable to SPT states with or without
    spatial symmetries. We show that in all dimensions short-range interactions can
    reduce the classification of free-fermion SPT states, and we demonstrate these
    results by making a connection between the fermionic and bosonic SPT states. We

    likely due to off-plane nonmagnetic (Ba, K) disorder, occurs mostly among neighboring

  abstract: The string-net approach by Levin and Wen and the local unitary transformation
    approach by Chen, Gu and Wen provided ways to systematically label non-chiral
    topological orders in 2D. In those approaches, different topologically ordered
    many-body wave functions were characterized by different fixed-point tensors.
    Though extremely powerful, the resulting fixed-point tensors were mathematical
    abstractions and thus lacked a physical interpretation. As a result it was hard
    to judge if two different fixed-point tensors described the same quantum phase
    or not. We want to improve that approach by giving a more physical description
    of the topological orders. We find that the non-Abelian Berry's phases, - and
    -matrices, of the topological protected degenerate ground states on a torus give
    rise to a more physical description of topological orders. Using the Verlinde
    conjecture, we can even choose the canonical basis for the - and -matrices. It
    is conjectured that the and -matrices form a complete and one-to-one characterization
    of non-chiral topological orders and can replace the fixed-point tensor description
    to give us a more physical label for topological orders. As a result, all the
    topological properties can be obtained from the - and -matrices, such as number
    of quasiparticle types (from the dimension of or ), the quasiparticle statistics
    (from the diagonal elements of ), the quantum dimensions of quasiparticles (from
    the first row of ), \etc.

  abstract: Topological degeneracy is the degeneracy of the ground states in a many-body
    system in the large-system-size limit. Topological degeneracy cannot be lifted
    by any local perturbation of the Hamiltonian. The topological degeneracies on
    closed manifolds have been used to discover/define topological order in many-body

    a line in two-dimensional topological ordered states. Such topological degeneracy
    can be viewed as carried by each end of the line defect, which is a generalization
    of Majorana zero modes. The topological degeneracy can be used as a quantum memory.
    The ends of line defects carry projective non-Abelian statistics even though they
    are produced by the condensation of Abelian anyons, and braiding them allows us

  abstract: In this Letter we consider spinless bosons in a kagome lattice with nearest-neighbor
    hopping and on-site interaction, and the sign of hopping is inverted by insetting
    a flux in each triangle of the kagome lattice so that the lowest single particle
    band is perfectly flat. We show that in the high-density limit, despite the infinite
    degeneracy of the single particle ground states, interaction will select out the
    Bloch state at the point of the Brillouin zone for boson condensation at the lowest
    temperature. As the temperature increases, the single-boson superfluid order can
    be easily destroyed, while an exotic triple-boson paired superfluid order will
    remain. We establish that this trion superfluid exists in a broad temperature
    regime until the temperature is increased to the same order of hopping and then
    the system turns into normal phases. Finally, we show that time-of-flight measurement

    geometric phases as we exchange quasiparticle excitations . Here we construct
    a rotor model that realizes a self-dual Abelian gauge theory. We find that lattice
    dislocation defects in the model produce topologically protected degeneracy. Even
    though dislocations are not quasiparticle excitations, they resemble non-Abelian
    anyons with quantum dimension . Exchanging dislocations can produce topologically
    protected projective non-Abelian geometric phases. Therefore, we discover a kind
    of (projective) non-Abelian anyon that appears as the dislocations in an Abelian
    rotor model. These types of non-Abelian anyons can be viewed as a generalization

    gives an estimate of possible parameter values, which in turn reaffirms the necessity
    of including both the Kitaev and farther neighbor couplings.

  abstract: We propose a theoretical description of the phase diagram and physical
    properties in -type ( , Tl) compounds based on a coexistent local moment and itinerant
    electron picture. Using neutron scattering and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
    measurements to fix the general structure of the local moment and itinerant Fermi
    pockets, we find a superconducting phase with -wave pairing at the pockets and
    an incipient sign-change wave near the point, which is adjacent to the insulating
    phases. The uniform susceptibility and resistivity are found to be consistent
    with the experiment. The main distinction with iron pnictide superconductors is
    also discussed.

  abstract: We study a unified mechanism for spin-density-wave (SDW) and superconductivity
    in a minimal model in which itinerant electrons and local moments coexist as previously
    proposed for the iron pnictides [Kou, Li, Weng, EPL 88, 17010 (2009)EULEEJ0295-507510.1209/0295-5075/88/17010].
    The phase diagram obtained at the mean-field level is in qualitative agreement
    with the experiment, which shows how the magnetic and superconducting (SC) instabilities
    are driven by the critical coupling between the itinerant/localized electrons.
    The spin and charge response functions at the random-phase-approximation level
    further characterize the dynamical evolution of the system. In particular, the
    dynamic spin susceptibility displays a Goldstone mode in the SDW phase, which
    evolves into a gapped resonance-like mode in the SC phase. The latter persists
    all the way into the normal state above where a strong …

  abstract: We study the spin excitations of the block-antiferromagnetic state in
    K Fe Se . Due to the nature of block antiferromagnetism, we expect spin-wave excitations
    to possess both Goldstone modes and optical branches. We use a simple model Hamiltonian
    to demonstrate this idea and compute the dispersion and the dynamic spin structure
    factor using explicit parameters. Our prediction can be directly tested by inelastic
    neutron-scattering experiments.

  abstract: Total reflection occurs when light travels from a medium with refractive
    index n to an optically less dense medium with refractive index n 0 at an incident
    angle equal to or greater than the critical angle θ c= arcsin (n 0∕ n)⁠. Besides
    being totally reflected, the incoming light penetrates into the less dense medium
    as an evanescent wave and travels for some distance parallel to the interface
    before being scattered back to the denser medium. If a third medium of refractive
    index n (that is, made of the same material as the first medium) is placed at
    a small distance d (of the same order of magnitude as the light wavelength) to
    the first medium, the incident light can travel partly through the middle medium
    into the third medium, and the reflected light in the first medium is weakened.
    This intriguing phenomenon is termed frustrated total internal reflection. A detailed
    review of theoretical and experimental studies on frustrated …
