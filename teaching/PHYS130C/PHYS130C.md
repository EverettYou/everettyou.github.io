### Schedule of Classes

* *Lecture*: Mon, Wed, Fri. 9:00 AM - 9:50 AM, Mandeville Center (MANDE) B-104

* *Discussion session*: Thu. 6:00 PM - 6:50 PM, Humanities and Social Sciences Building (HSS) 1128A

* *Instructor*: Yi-Zhuang You (尤亦庄) (sounds like EACH-ONE, YOU) (He/Him/His)

  * *Email*: <yzyou@ucsd.edu>

  * *Office hours*: by schedule, Mayer 5202 or Zoom <https://ucsd.zoom.us/my/yzyou>

* *Teaching Assistants*: Shuhan Zhang.  *Email*: <shz091@ucsd.edu>

* **Course Grade Allocation**: 
  - Homework: 70% 
  - Term Paper: 30%

* **Assignment and Submission Platform**: Homework and term paper will be assigned and submitted via the [UCSD Canvas](https://canvas.ucsd.edu/courses/62629){:target="_blank"} online platform.

* **Homework Guidelines**:

  - Assignments will occur irregularly, depending on when the homework problem is encountered in the lecture.
  
  - A recommended deadline will be provided for each assignment. However, there are no penalties for late submissions (meaning that submissions are accepted until the end of the quarter). But please kindly manage your submissions to alleviate the TA's workload.
  
  - For homework, discussion among students and consulting with the TA are allowed. You may utilize all educational resources (including AI language models). Nevertheless, you are required to complete your assignments by yourself to maintain academic integrity. You are encouraged to acknowledge in your homework the resources that are helpful to you.

* **Term Paper Guidelines**:

  - The term paper should relate to the content of this course. You have the flexibility to choose topics such as:
	  - In-depth exploration of a specific topic covered in the course.
	  - Connection between the course material and your own research practices.
	  - Personal reflections or insights gained during your study of quantum mechanics.
  
  - General Requirements:
	  - Papers must be written in a clear, professional style, suitable for an academic audience.
	  - Cite all sources, including textbooks, research papers, and any external material you consulted.
	  - Aim for a length of 3-8 pages.
  
  - The use of AI language models (e.g., ChatGPT) is allowed and encouraged for drafting, brainstorming, and editing your term paper. However, all contributions from AI tools must be appropriately acknowledged. Misrepresentation of AI-generated content as entirely your own work will be considered a breach of academic integrity.
