### Textbooks

The lecture will closely follow this book:

[1] Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman, *Quantum Mechanics (the Theoretical Minimum)*. Basic Books, New York. (2014)

But if you feel that [1] is too brief and want to learn more details, you can find them in the following two books:

[2] R. Shankar, *Principles of Quantum Mechanics*. Plenum Press, New York. (1994)

[3] J. J. Sakurai, *Modern Quantum Mechanics*. Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. (1994)
