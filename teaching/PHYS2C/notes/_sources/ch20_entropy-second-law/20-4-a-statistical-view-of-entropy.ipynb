    "● The entropy of a system can be defined in terms of the possible distributions of its molecules. For identical molecules, each possible distribution of molecules is called a microstate of the system. All equivalent microstates are grouped into a configuration of the system. The number of microstates in a configuration is the multiplicity _W_ of the configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "● For a system of _N_ molecules that may be distributed between the two halves of a box, the multiplicity is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "in which _n_ 1 is the number of molecules in one half of the box and _n_ 2 is the number in the other half. A basic assumption of statistical mechanics is that all the microstates are equally probable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, configurations with a large multiplicity occur most often. When _N_ is very large (say, _N_ � 10[22] molecules or more), the molecules are nearly always in the configuration in which \n",
    "\n",
    "_n_ 1 � _n_ 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "● The multiplicity _W_ of a configuration of a system and the entropy _S_ of the system in that configuration are related by Boltzmann’s entropy equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "where _k_ � 1.38 � 10[�][23] J/K is the Boltzmann constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "● When _N_ is very large (the usual case), we can approximate ln _N_ ! with Stirling’s approximation: ln _N_ ! � _N_ (ln _N_ ) � _N._\n"
