    "● An irreversible process is one that cannot be reversed by means of small changes in the environment. The direction in which an irreversible process proceeds is set by the change in entropy � _S_ of the system undergoing the process. Entropy _S_ is a state property (or state function) of the system; that is, it depends only on the state of the system and not on the way in which the system reached that state. The entropy postulate states (in part): If an irreversible process occurs in a closed system, the entropy of the system always increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "● The entropy change � _S_ for an irreversible process that takes a system from an initial state _i_ to a final state _f_ is exactly equal to the entropy change � _S_ for any reversible process that takes the system between those same two states. We can compute the latter (but not the former) with \n",
    "\n",
    "Here _Q_ is the energy transferred as heat to or from the system during the process, and _T_ is the temperature of the system in kelvins during the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "● For a reversible isothermal process, the expression for an entropy change reduces to \n",
    "\n",
    "� _S_ � _Sf_ � _Si_ � _[Q] T_[.] ● When the temperature change � _T_ of a system is small relative to the temperature (in kelvins) before and after the process, the entropy change can be approximated as \n",
    "\n",
    "where _T_ avg is the system’s average temperature during the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "● When an ideal gas changes reversibly from an initial state with temperature _Ti_ and volume _Vi_ to a final state with temperature _Tf_ and volume _Vf_ , the change � _S_ in the entropy of the gas is \n",

It never decreases. In equation form, \n",
