    "- **16.18** Apply the principle of superposition to show that two overlapping waves add algebraically to give a resultant (or net) wave. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **16.19** For two transverse waves with the same amplitude and wavelength and that travel together, find the displacement equation for the resultant wave and calculate the amplitude in terms of the individual wave amplitude and the phase difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **16.20** Describe how the phase difference between two transverse waves (with the same amplitude and wavelength) can result in fully constructive interference, fully destructive interference, and intermediate interference. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **16.21** With the phase difference between two interfering waves expressed in terms of wavelengths, quickly determine the type of interference the waves have. \n",

    "● When two or more waves traverse the same medium, the displacement of any particle of the medium is the sum of the displacements that the individual waves would give it, an effect known as the principle of superposition for waves. \n",

    "If f � 0, the waves are exactly in phase and their interference is fully constructive; if f � p rad, they are exactly out of phase and their interference is fully destructive.\n"
