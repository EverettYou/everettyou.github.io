    "## Key Ideas \n",
    "\n",
    "● The interference of two identical sinusoidal waves moving in opposite directions produces standing waves. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "Standing waves are characterized by fixed locations of zero displacement called nodes and fixed locations of maximum displacement called antinodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "● Standing waves on a string can be set up by reflection of traveling waves from the ends of the string. If an end is fixed, it must be the position of a node. This limits the frequencies at \n",
    "\n",
    "which standing waves will occur on a given string. Each possible frequency is a resonant frequency, and the corresponding standing wave pattern is an oscillation mode. For a stretched string of length _L_ with fixed ends, the resonant frequencies are \n",
    "\n",
    "The oscillation mode corresponding to _n_ � 1 is called the _fundamental mode_ or the _first harmonic_ ; the mode corresponding to _n_ � 2 is the _second harmonic_ ; and so on.\n"
