    "\n",
    "● A wave _y_ ( _x_ , _t_ ) can be represented with a phasor. This is a vector that has a magnitude equal to the amplitude _ym_ of the wave and that rotates about an origin with an angular speed \n",
    "\n",
    "equal to the angular frequency v of the wave. The projection of the rotating phasor on a vertical axis gives the displacement _y_ of a point along the wave’s travel. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Phasors** \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding two waves as discussed in the preceding module is strictly limited to waves with _identical_ amplitudes. If we have such waves, that technique is easy enough to use, but we need a more general technique that can be applied to any waves, whether or not they have the same amplitudes. One neat way is to use phasors to represent the waves. Although this may seem bizarre at first, it is essentially a graphical technique that uses the vector addition rules of Chapter 3 instead of messy trig additions. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **phasor** is a vector that rotates around its tail, which is pivoted at the origin of a coordinate system.The magnitude of the vector is equal to the amplitude _ym_ of the wave that it represents.The angular speed of the rotation is equal to the angular frequency v of the wave. For example, the wave \n",
    "\n",
    "is represented by the phasor shown in Figs. 16-15 _a_ to _d_ . The magnitude of the phasor is the amplitude _ym_ 1 of the wave. As the phasor rotates around the origin at angular speed v, its projection _y_ 1 on the vertical axis varies sinusoidally, from a � maximum of _ym_ 1 through zero to a minimum of _ym_ 1 and then back to _ym_ 1. This variation corresponds to the sinusoidal variation in the displacement _y_ 1 of any point along the string as the wave passes through that point. (All this is shown as an animation with voiceover in _WileyPLUS_ .) \n",
    "\n",
    "When two waves travel along the same string in the same direction, we can represent them and their resultant wave in a _phasor diagram_ . The phasors in Fig. 16-15 _e_ represent the wave of Eq. 16-55 and a second wave given by \n",
    "\n",
    "This second wave is phase-shifted from the first wave by phase constant f. Because the phasors rotate at the same angular speed v, the angle between the two phasors is always f. If f is a _positive_ quantity, then the phasor for wave 2 _lags_ the phasor for wave 1 as they rotate, as drawn in Fig. 16-15 _e_ . If f is a negative quantity, then the phasor for wave 2 _leads_ the phasor for wave 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because waves _y_ 1 and _y_ 2 have the same angular wave number _k_ and angular frequency v, we know from Eqs. 16-51 and 16-52 that their resultant is of the form \n",
    "\n",
    "_y_ �( _x_ , _t_ ) � _y_ � _m_ sin( _kx_ � v _t_ � b), (16-57) \n",
    "**Figure 16-15** ( _a_ )–( _d_ ) A phasor of magnitude _ym_ 1 rotating about an origin at angular speed v represents a sinusoidal wave.The phasor’s projection _y_ 1 on the vertical axis represents the displacement of a point through which the wave passes. ( _e_ ) A second phasor, also of angular speed v but of magnitude _ym_ 2 and rotating at a constant angle f from the first phasor, represents a second wave, with a phase constant f. ( _f_ ) The resultant wave is represented by the vector sum _y_ � _m_ of the two phasors. \n",

    "where _y_ � _m_ is the amplitude of the resultant wave and b is its phase constant. To find the values of _y_ � _m_ and b, we would have to sum the two combining waves, as we did to obtain Eq. 16-51.To do this on a phasor diagram, we vectorially add the two phasors at any instant during their rotation, as in Fig. 16-15 _f_ where phasor _ym_ 2 has been shifted to the head of phasor _ym_ 1. The magnitude of the vector sum � equals the amplitude _y m_ in Eq. 16-57. The angle between the vector sum and the phasor for _y_ 1 equals the phase constant b in Eq. 16-57. \n",

    "## Sample Problem 16.05 Interference of two waves, same direction, phasors, any amplitudes \n",
    "\n",
    "Two sinusoidal waves _y_ 1( _x_ , _t_ ) and _y_ 2( _x_ , _t_ ) have the same wavelength and travel together in the same direction along a string. Their amplitudes are _ym_ 1 � 4.0 mm and _ym_ 2 � 3.0 mm, and their phase constants are 0 and p/3 rad, respectively. What are the amplitude _y_ � _m_ and phase constant b of the resultant wave? Write the resultant wave in the form of Eq. 16-57. \n",
    "\n",
    "## KEY IDEAS \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The two waves have a number of properties in common: Because they travel along the same string, they must have the same speed _v_ , as set by the tension and linear density of the string according to Eq. 16-26. With the same wavelength l, they have the same angular wave number _k_ (� 2p/l). Also, because they have the same wave number _k_ and speed _v_ , they must have the same angular frequency v (� _kv_ ). \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) The waves (call them waves 1 and 2) can be represented by phasors rotating at the same angular speed v about an origin. Because the phase constant for wave 2 is _greater_ than that for wave 1 by p/3, phasor 2 must _lag_ phasor 1 by p/3 rad in their clockwise rotation, as shown in Fig. 16-16 _a_ . The resultant wave due to the interference of waves 1 and 2 can then be represented by a phasor that is the vector sum of phasors 1 and 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Calculations:_ To simplify the vector summation, we drew phasors 1 and 2 in Fig. 16-16 _a_ at the instant when phasor 1 lies along the horizontal axis. We then drew lagging phasor 2 at positive angle p/3 rad. In Fig. 16-16 _b_ we shifted phasor 2 so its tail is at the head of phasor 1. Then we can draw the phasor _y_ � _m_ of the resultant wave from the tail of phasor 1 to the head of phasor 2. The phase constant b is the angle phasor _y_ � _m_ makes with phasor 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find values for _y_ � _m_ and b, we can sum phasors 1 and 2 as vectors on a vector-capable calculator. However, here \n",
    "\n",
    "we shall sum them by components. (They are called horizontal and vertical components, because the symbols _x_ and _y_ are already used for the waves themselves.) For the horizontal components we have \n",
    "\n",
    "From Fig. 16-16 _b_ , phase constant b is a _positive_ angle relative to phasor 1.Thus, the resultant wave _lags_ wave 1 in their travel by phase constant b ��0.44 rad. From Eq. 16-57, we can write the resultant wave as \n",

    "_y_ �( _x_ , _t_ ) � (6.1 mm) sin( _kx_ � v _t_ � 0.44 rad). (Answer) \n",
