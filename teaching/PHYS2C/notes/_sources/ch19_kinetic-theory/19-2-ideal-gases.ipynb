    "● An ideal gas is one for which the pressure _p_ , volume _V_ , and temperature _T_ are related by \n",
    "\n",
    "where the Boltzmann constant _k_ is \n",
    "\n",
    "Here _n_ is the number of moles of the gas present and _R_ is a constant (8.31 J/mol �K) called the gas constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "● The work done _by_ an ideal gas during an isothermal (constant-temperature) change from volume _Vi_ to volume _Vf_ is \n",
    "\n",
    "● The ideal gas law can also be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "_V f W_ � _nRT_ ln (ideal gas, isothermal process). _pV_ � _NkT_ , _Vi_\n"
