        "- Archimedes' principle states that when a body is fully or partially submerged in a fluid, the fluid pushes upward with a buoyant force with magnitude $F_b = m_f g$, where $m_f$ is the mass of the fluid that has been pushed out of the way by the body.\n",
        "- When a body floats in a fluid, the magnitude $F_b$ of the (upward) buoyant force on the body is equal to the magnitude $F_g$ of the (downward) gravitational force on the body.\n",
        "- The apparent weight of a body on which a buoyant force acts is related to its actual weight by $\\text{weight}_{\\text{app}} = \\text{weight} - F_b$.\n"
