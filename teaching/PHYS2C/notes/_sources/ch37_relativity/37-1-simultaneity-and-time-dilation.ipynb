        "**2. Speed of light postulate:** The speed of light in vacuum has the same value $c$ in all directions and in all inertial frames.\n",

        "This implies an **ultimate speed** $c$—no entity carrying energy or information can exceed it. Particles with mass cannot reach $c$ no matter how long they are accelerated. The exact value is $c = 2.997\\,924\\,58\\times 10^8$ m/s.\n",

        "The reason is the second postulate: light has the same speed $c$ in both frames. In a classic thought experiment, two flashes occur at the ends of a moving train. An observer on the train (midpoint) sees them arrive simultaneously and concludes the flashes were simultaneous. A ground observer sees the flash from the rear arrive first (the train has moved), and concludes the rear flash occurred earlier. Both are correct in their own frames.\n",
