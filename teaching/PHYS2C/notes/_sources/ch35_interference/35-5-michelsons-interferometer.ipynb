        "- **Michelson's interferometer** (1881) splits a light beam into two, sends them along different paths (arms), and recombines them. The interference pattern depends on the **path length difference**.\n",
        "- Moving a mirror or inserting a transparent material changes the phase difference and **shifts the fringes**. Counting fringe shifts allows precise measurement of distances in terms of wavelengths.\n",
        "- The device was historically crucial: Michelson expressed the meter in wavelengths of light (Nobel Prize 1907), leading to the modern definition of length.\n",
