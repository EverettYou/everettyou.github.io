      "source": "## Lecture Notes\n\n### Overview\n\n- For an **interference pattern** to be visible, the two waves must be **coherent**\u2014their phase difference must stay constant in time.\n- The **intensity** at a point on the screen is $I = 4I_0\\cos^2(\\phi/2)$, where $\\phi$ is the phase difference and $I_0$ is the intensity from one slit alone.\n- **Phasors** (section 16-6) provide a geometric way to add the electric fields and find the resultant intensity.\n- Interference **redistributes** energy; it does not create or destroy it. The average intensity is $2I_0$ in both coherent and incoherent cases.\n\n---\n\n### Coherence\n\n**Coherent** light: the phase difference between the two waves at any point remains constant in time.\n\n- In Young's experiment, both slits are illuminated by the **same** wave from the single slit $S_0$. The light at $S_1$ and $S_2$ is therefore coherent.\n- **Incoherent** light: phase difference varies randomly (e.g., two independent incandescent bulbs). The interference fluctuates rapidly between constructive and destructive; the eye averages over time and sees **uniform** illumination $2I_0$\u2014no fringes.\n\n:::{admonition} Why a single slit?\n:class: note\n\nThe single slit in Young's setup serves two roles: (1) it creates **coherent** light (waves from one small source); (2) diffraction spreads that light to illuminate both slits. Direct sunlight at the two slits would be incoherent\u2014the slits are too far apart.\n:::\n\n**Lasers** emit coherent light (atoms emit cooperatively). Ordinary sources (incandescent, fluorescent) are incoherent over typical slit separations.\n\n---\n\n### Intensity in double-slit interference\n\nThe electric fields at point $P$ from the two slits are\n\n$$\nE_1 = E_0\\sin(\\omega t), \\qquad E_2 = E_0\\sin(\\omega t + \\phi)\n$$ (eq-E1-E2)\n\nwhere $\\phi$ is the phase difference (from path length difference). The **intensity** at $P$ is\n\n$$\nI = 4I_0\\cos^2\\frac{\\phi}{2}\n$$ (eq-I-phi)\n\nHere $I_0$ is the intensity that would appear on the screen from **one** slit when the other is covered (assumed uniform over the fringe region).\n\n**Phase difference and angle**:\n\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\,d\\sin\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\,\\Delta L\n$$ (eq-phi-theta)\n\nSo we can also write\n\n$$\nI = 4I_0\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi d\\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$ (eq-I-theta)\n\n---\n\n### Maxima and minima from the intensity formula\n\nFrom $I = 4I_0\\cos^2(\\phi/2)$:\n\n| Condition | $\\phi$ | $d\\sin\\theta$ |\n|-----------|---------|------------------|\n| **Maximum** ($I = 4I_0$) | $\\phi = 2m\\pi$ | $m\\lambda$ |\n| **Minimum** ($I = 0$)   | $\\phi = (2m+1)\\pi$ | $(m + \\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$ |\n\nThese match the conditions from section 35-2. The intensity formula encodes both the locations and the **gradual** variation between bright and dark fringes.\n\n---\n\n### Phasor derivation\n\nTwo waves of amplitude $E_0$ with phase difference $\\phi$ are represented by phasors of length $E_0$ at angle $\\phi$ apart. Their **vector sum** has magnitude\n\n$$\nE = 2E_0\\cos\\frac{\\phi}{2}\n$$ (eq-E-phasor)\n\n(From the isosceles triangle: the resultant bisects the angle $\\phi$; each half is $E_0\\cos(\\phi/2)$, so $E = 2E_0\\cos(\\phi/2)$.)\n\nSince intensity $I \\propto E^2$ and $I_0 \\propto E_0^2$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{I}{I_0} = \\frac{E^2}{E_0^2} = 4\\cos^2\\frac{\\phi}{2}\n$$ (eq-I-from-E)\n\nwhich gives Eq. [](#eq-I-phi).\n\n:::{admonition} Phasors for light\n:class: seealso\n\nSame phasor method as section 16-6 (mechanical waves). For light, we add **electric field** phasors; intensity is proportional to $E^2$.\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Energy and average intensity\n\nInterference **redistributes** energy over the screen\u2014it does not create or destroy it.\n\n- **Coherent** sources: $I$ varies from $0$ to $4I_0$; **average** $I_{\\text{avg}} = 2I_0$ (from $\\langle\\cos^2(\\phi/2)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}$).\n- **Incoherent** sources: no fringes; uniform $I = 2I_0$ everywhere.\n\nIn both cases, the total power on the screen is the same. Coherent light concentrates it into bright fringes; incoherent light spreads it uniformly.\n\n---\n\n### Combining more than two waves\n\nFor three or more waves arriving at a point:\n\n1. Draw phasors for each wave, **end to end**, preserving the phase relations.\n2. The **vector sum** gives the resultant amplitude; its length squared (times a constant) gives the intensity.\n\nThis generalizes the two-phasor construction and is used for multiple slits (Chapter 36) and other interference configurations.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Coherent** light: constant phase difference; required for visible interference. **Incoherent**: no fringes, uniform $2I_0$.\n- **Intensity**: $I = 4I_0\\cos^2(\\phi/2)$ with $\\phi = (2\\pi/\\lambda)d\\sin\\theta$.\n- **Phasors**: add electric field phasors; resultant amplitude $E = 2E_0\\cos(\\phi/2)$.\n- **Energy**: average intensity $2I_0$; interference redistributes, does not create energy."
