    "- **34.23** Distinguish converging lenses from diverging lenses. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.24** For converging and diverging lenses, sketch a ray diagram for rays initially parallel to the central axis, indicating how they form focal points, and identifying which is real and which is virtual. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.25** Distinguish a real focal point from a virtual focal point, identify which corresponds to which type of lens and under which circumstances, and identify the algebraic sign associated with each focal length. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.26** For an object (a) inside and (b) outside the focal point of a converging lens, sketch at least two rays to find the image and identify the type and orientation of the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.27** For a converging lens, distinguish the locations and orientations of a real image and a virtual image. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.28** For an object in front of a diverging lens, sketch at least two rays to find the image and identify the type and orientation of the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.29** Identify which type of lens can produce both real \n",
    "\n",
    "and virtual images and which type can produce only virtual images. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.30** Identify the algebraic sign of the image distance _i_ for a real image and for a virtual image. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.31** For converging and diverging lenses, apply the relationship between the focal length _f_ , object distance _p_ , and image distance _i_ . \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.32** Apply the relationships between lateral magnification _m_ , image height _h_ �, object height _h_ , image distance _i_ , and object distance _p_ . \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.33** Apply the lens maker’s equation to relate a focal length to the index of refraction of a lens (assumed to be in air) and the radii of curvature of the two sides of the lens. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.34** For a multiple-lens system with the object in front of lens 1, find the image produced by lens 1 and then use it as the object for lens 2, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.35** For a multiple-lens system, determine the overall magnification (of the final image) from the magnifications produced by each lens. \n",

    "## Key Ideas \n",
    "\n",
    "- This module primarily considers thin lenses with symmetric, \n",
    "\n",
    "- spherical surfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If parallel rays are sent through a converging lens \n",
    "\n",
    "- parallel to the central axis, the refracted rays pass through a common point (a real focus _F_ ) at a focal distance _f_ (a positive quantity) from the lens. If they are sent through a diverging lens, backward extensions of the refracted rays pass through a common point (a virtual focus _F_ ) at a focal distance _f_ (a negative quantity) from the lens. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A converging lens can form a real image (if the object is \n",
    "\n",
    "- outside the focal point) or a virtual image (if the object is inside the focal point). \n",
    "\n",
    "- A diverging lens can form only a virtual image. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For an object in front of a lens, object distance _p_ and \n",
    "\n",
    "- image distance _i_ are related to the lens’s focal length _f_ , index \n",
    "\n",
    "and is related to the object distance _p_ and image distance _i_ by \n",
    "\n",
    "● For a system of lenses with a common central axis, the image produced by the first lens acts as the object for the second lens, and so on, and the overall magnification is the product of the individual magnifications.\n"
