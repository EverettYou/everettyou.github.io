        "The nucleus is modeled as a **liquid drop**: incompressible, with short-range attractive forces between nucleons (analogous to molecules in a droplet). Key ideas:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Saturation:** Nuclear force saturates — each nucleon attracts only nearby neighbors. Binding energy per nucleon is roughly constant (section 42-2).\n",
        "- **Surface effect:** Nucleons at the surface have fewer neighbors → less binding. A surface term *reduces* $E_b$.\n",
        "- **Coulomb repulsion:** Protons repel. A Coulomb term *reduces* $E_b$ and grows with $Z^2/A^{1/3}$.\n",
        "- **Asymmetry:** For fixed $A$, $N \\neq Z$ costs energy (Pauli exclusion). Stable light nuclei prefer $N \\approx Z$; heavy nuclei need more neutrons to dilute Coulomb repulsion.\n",

Nuclei with magic $Z$ or $N$ (e.g., $^4\\text{He}$, $^{16}\\text{O}$, $^{40}\\text{Ca}$, $^{208}\\text{Pb}$) are unusually stable. **Doubly magic** nuclei ($Z$ and $N$ both magic), such as $^{208}\\text{Pb}$ ($Z=82$, $N=126$), are especially stable.\n",
