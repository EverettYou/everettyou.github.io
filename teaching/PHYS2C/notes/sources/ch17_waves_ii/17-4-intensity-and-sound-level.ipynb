    "● The intensity _I_ of a sound wave at a surface is the average rate per unit area at which energy is transferred by the wave through or onto the surface: \n",
    "\n",
    "where _P_ is the time rate of energy transfer (power) of the sound wave and _A_ is the area of the surface intercepting the sound. The intensity _I_ is related to the displacement amplitude _sm_ of the sound wave by \n",
    "\n",
    "● The intensity at a distance _r_ from a point source that emits sound waves of power _Ps_ equally in all directions (isotropically) is \n",
    "\n",
    "- The sound level b in decibels (dB) is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "where _I_ 0 (� 10[�][12] W/m[2] ) is a reference intensity level to which all intensities are compared. For every factor-of-10 increase in intensity, 10 dB is added to the sound level. \n",
