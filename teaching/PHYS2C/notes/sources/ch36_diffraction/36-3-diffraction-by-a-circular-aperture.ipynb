      "source": "## Lecture Notes\n\n### Overview\n\n- **Circular aperture** (lens, pinhole, pupil) produces a diffraction pattern: central bright disk plus concentric rings. The first minimum is at $\\sin\\theta = 1.22\\,\\lambda/d$ (factor 1.22 from circular geometry).\n- **Resolution**: When two point sources are close, their diffraction patterns overlap. If they overlap too much, we cannot distinguish them.\n- **Rayleigh's criterion**: Two objects are barely resolvable when the central maximum of one coincides with the first minimum of the other: $\\theta_R = 1.22\\,\\lambda/d$.\n- **Applications**: Limits on telescope/eye resolution; pointillism; microscopy with UV.\n\n---\n\n### Diffraction by a circular aperture\n\nLight passing through a **circular aperture** of diameter $d$ (e.g., a lens or pinhole) forms a diffraction pattern: a **central bright disk** (Airy disk) surrounded by progressively fainter **concentric rings**.\n\n**First minimum** (angle from central axis to the first dark ring):\n\n$$\n\\sin\\theta = 1.22\\,\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\n$$ (eq-circular-min)\n\nCompare to a **rectangular slit** of width $a$: $a\\sin\\theta = \\lambda$. The factor **1.22** arises from the circular geometry (derivation requires integration over the aperture).\n\nFor small $\\theta$: $\\theta \\approx 1.22\\,\\lambda/d$. The **radius** of the first dark ring on a screen at distance $D$ is $y \\approx D\\theta = 1.22\\,D\\lambda/d$.\n\n---\n\n### Resolvability\n\nWhen we image two **point objects** (e.g., two stars) through a lens, each produces its own diffraction pattern. If the objects are close, the patterns overlap.\n\n| Overlap | Result |\n|--------|--------|\n| Heavy overlap | Objects appear as one\u2014**not resolved** |\n| Central max of one at first min of other | **Barely resolved** (Rayleigh's criterion) |\n| Patterns well separated | **Clearly resolved** |\n\n**Rayleigh's criterion**: Two point sources are on the **verge of resolvability** when the central maximum of one diffraction pattern falls on the first minimum of the other. The minimum angular separation is\n\n$$\n\\theta_R = 1.22\\,\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\n$$ (eq-rayleigh)\n\nwhere $d$ is the diameter of the aperture (lens, pupil, etc.). If the actual angular separation $\\theta > \\theta_R$, the objects can be resolved; if $\\theta < \\theta_R$, they cannot.\n\n:::{admonition} Human vision\n:class: note\n\nThe pupil is a circular aperture. Rayleigh's criterion is an approximation\u2014actual resolvability depends on contrast, turbulence, and the visual system. The real limit is often somewhat larger than $\\theta_R$.\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Improving resolution\n\nFrom $\\theta_R = 1.22\\,\\lambda/d$:\n\n| Change | Effect on $\\theta_R$ | Resolution |\n|--------|------------------------|------------|\n| **Larger** aperture $d$ | $\\theta_R$ smaller | **Better** |\n| **Shorter** wavelength $\\lambda$ | $\\theta_R$ smaller | **Better** |\n\n- **Telescopes**: Large diameter $d$ reduces $\\theta_R$ $\\Rightarrow$ can resolve closer stars.\n- **Microscopes**: UV light ($\\lambda$ shorter than visible) improves resolution.\n- **Bright light**: Pupil constricts ($d$ smaller) $\\Rightarrow$ $\\theta_R$ increases $\\Rightarrow$ **worse** resolution (considering diffraction only).\n\n---\n\n### Pointillism\n\n**Pointillism** uses many small colored dots to form an image. The apparent color depends on viewing distance:\n\n- **Close**: Angular separation $\\theta$ of adjacent dots $> \\theta_R$ $\\Rightarrow$ dots are **resolved** $\\Rightarrow$ you see the true paint colors.\n- **Far**: $\\theta < \\theta_R$ $\\Rightarrow$ dots **blend** $\\Rightarrow$ your brain combines light from several dots into a perceived color that may not exist in any single dot.\n\nThe painter exploits your eye's diffraction limit to create colors through optical mixing.\n\n:::{admonition} Example: Viewing distance for pointillism\n:class: seealso dropdown\n\nDots separated by $D = 2.0$ mm, pupil diameter $d = 1.5$ mm. For $\\theta = D/L$ (small angle) and $\\theta_R = 1.22\\lambda/d$, the least distance at which dots become irresolvable is $L = Dd/(1.22\\lambda)$. For blue light ($\\lambda = 400$ nm): $L \\approx 6.2$ m. Red dots (longer $\\lambda$) blend first as you step back.\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Circular aperture**: First minimum at $\\sin\\theta = 1.22\\lambda/d$; central disk + concentric rings.\n- **Rayleigh's criterion**: $\\theta_R = 1.22\\lambda/d$; two sources barely resolvable when one's central max is at the other's first min.\n- **Better resolution**: Larger $d$ or shorter $\\lambda$.\n- **Pointillism**: Dots resolvable when close; blend when $\\theta < \\theta_R$ (far away)."
