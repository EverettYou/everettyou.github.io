    "- **34.18** Identify that the refraction of rays by a spherical surface can produce real images and virtual images of an object, depending on the indexes of refraction on the two sides, the surface’s radius of curvature _r_ , and whether the object faces a concave or convex surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.19** For a point object on the central axis of a spherical refracting surface, sketch the refraction of a ray in the six general arrangements and identify whether the image is real or virtual. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.20** For a spherical refracting surface, identify what type of image appears on the same side as the object and what type appears on the opposite side. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **34.21** For a spherical refracting surface, apply the relationship between the two indexes of refraction, the object distance _p_ , the image distance _i_ , and the radius of curvature _r_ . \n",

    "- **34.22** Identify the algebraic signs of the radius _r_ for an object facing a concave refracting surface and a convex refracting surface. \n",

    "- A single spherical surface that refracts light can form \n",

    "\n",
    "- The object distance _p_ , the image distance _i_ , \n",
    "\n",
    "- and the radius of curvature _r_ of the surface are related by \n",
    "\n",
    "where _n_ 1 is the index of refraction of the material where the object is located and _n_ 2 is the index of refraction on the other side of the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the surface faced by the object is convex, _r_ is positive, \n",
    "\n",
    "- and if it is concave, _r_ is negative. \n",

    "- Images on the object’s side of the surface are virtual, and \n",
    "\n",
    "- images on the opposite side are real.\n"
