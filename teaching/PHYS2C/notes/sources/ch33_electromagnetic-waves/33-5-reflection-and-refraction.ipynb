    "- **33.36** With a sketch, show the reflection of a light ray from an interface and identify the incident ray, the reflected ray, the normal, the angle of incidence, and the angle of reflection. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **33.37** For a reflection, relate the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **33.38** With a sketch, show the refraction of a light ray at an interface and identify the incident ray, the refracted ray, the normal on each side of the interface, the angle of incidence, and the angle of refraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **33.39** For refraction of light, apply Snell’s law to relate the index of refraction and the angle of the ray on one side of the interface to those quantities on the other side. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **33.40** In a sketch and using a line along the undeflected direction, show the refraction of light from one material into \n",
    "\n",
    "   - a second material that has a greater index, a smaller index, and the same index, and, for each situation, describe the refraction in terms of the ray being bent toward the normal, away from the normal, or not at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **33.41** Identify that refraction occurs only at an interface and not in the interior of a material. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **33.42** Identify chromatic dispersion. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **33.43** For a beam of red and blue light (or other colors) refracting at an interface, identify which color has the greater bending and which has the greater angle of refraction when they enter a material with a lower index than the initial material and a greater index. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **33.44** Describe how the primary and secondary rainbows are formed and explain why they are circular arcs. \n",

    "## Key Ideas \n",

    "- Geometrical optics is an approximate treatment of light in \n",
    "\n",
    "- which light waves are represented as straight-line rays. \n",
    "\n",
    "● When a light ray encounters a boundary between two transparent media, a reflected ray and a refracted ray generally appear. Both rays remain in the plane of incidence. The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence, and \n",
    "\n",
    "the angle of refraction is related to the angle of incidence by Snell’s law, \n",
    "\n",
    "where _n_ 1 and _n_ 2 are the indexes of refraction of the media in which the incident and refracted rays travel.\n"
