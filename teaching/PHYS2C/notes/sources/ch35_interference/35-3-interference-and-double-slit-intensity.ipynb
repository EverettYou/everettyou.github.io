    "● If two light waves that meet at a point are to interfere perceptibly, the phase difference between them must remain constant with time; that is, the waves must be coherent. When two coherent waves meet, the resulting intensity may be found by using phasors. \n",
    "\n",
    "● In Young’s interference experiment, two waves, each with intensity _I_ 0, yield a resultant wave of intensity _I_ at the viewing screen, with _I_ � 4 _I_ 0 cos[2][1] 2[f][,][where][ f][ �][2][p] l _[d]_ sin u.\n"
