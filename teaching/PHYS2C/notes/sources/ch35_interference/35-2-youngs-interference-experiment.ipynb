    "- **35.13** Describe the diffraction of light by a narrow slit and the effect of narrowing the slit. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.14** With sketches, describe the production of the interference pattern in a double-slit interference experiment using monochromatic light. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.15** Identify that the phase difference between two waves can change if the waves travel along paths of different lengths, as in the case of Young’s experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.16** In a double-slit experiment, apply the relationship between the path length difference � _L_ and the wavelength l, and then interpret the result in terms of interference (maximum brightness, intermediate brightness, and darkness). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.17** For a given point in a double-slit interference pattern, express the path length difference � _L_ of the rays reaching that point in terms of the slit separation _d_ and the angle u to that point. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.18** In a Young's experiment, apply the relationships between the slit separation _d_ , the light wavelength l, and the \n",
    "\n",
    "   - angles u to the minima (dark fringes) and to the maxima (bright fringes) in the interference pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.19** Sketch the double-slit interference pattern, identifying what lies at the center and what the various bright and dark fringes are called (such as “first side maximum” and “third order”). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.20** Apply the relationship between the distance _D_ between a double-slit screen and a viewing screen, the angle u to a point in the interference pattern, and the distance _y_ to that point from the pattern’s center. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.21** For a double-slit interference pattern, identify the effects of changing _d_ or l and also identify what determines the angular limit to the pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.22** For a transparent material placed over one slit in a Young’s experiment, determine the thickness or index of refraction required to shift a given fringe to the center of the interference pattern. \n",

    "## Key Ideas \n",
    "\n",
    "● In Young’s interference experiment, light passing through a single slit falls on two slits in a screen. The light leaving these slits flares out (by diffraction), and interference occurs in the region beyond the screen. A fringe pattern, due to the interference, forms on a viewing screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "● The conditions for maximum and minimum intensity are \n",
    "\n",
    "where u is the angle the light path makes with a central axis and _d_ is the slit separation.\n"
