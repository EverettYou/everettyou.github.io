    "● When light is incident on a thin transparent film, the light waves reflected from the front and back surfaces interfere. For near-normal incidence, the wavelength conditions for maximum and minimum intensity of the light reflected from a _film in air_ are \n",
    "\n",
    "where _n_ 2 is the index of refraction of the film, _L_ is its thickness, and l is the wavelength of the light in air. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If a film is sandwiched between media other than air, these \n",
    "\n",
    "- equations for bright and dark films may be interchanged, depending on the relative indexes of refraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the light incident at an interface between media with \n",
    "\n",
    "- different indexes of refraction is in the medium with the smaller index of refraction, the reflection causes a phase change of p rad, or half a wavelength, in the reflected wave. Otherwise, there is no phase change due to the reflection. Refraction causes no phase shift. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 35-15** Light waves, represented with ray _i_ , are incident on a thin film of thickness _L_ and index of refraction _n_ 2. Rays _r_ 1 and _r_ 2 represent light waves that have been reflected by the front and back surfaces of the film, respectively. (All three rays are actually nearly perpendicular to the film.) The interference of the waves of _r_ 1 and _r_ 2 with each other depends on their phase difference. The index of refraction _n_ 1 of the medium at the left can differ from the index of refraction _n_ 3 of the medium at the right, but for now we assume that both media are air, with _n_ 1 � _n_ 3 � 1.0, which is less than _n_ 2.\n"
