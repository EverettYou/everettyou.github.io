    "## Learning Objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "_After reading this module, you should be able to . . ._ \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.01** Using a sketch, explain Huygens’ principle. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.02** With a few simple sketches, explain refraction in terms of the gradual change in the speed of a wavefront as it passes through an interface at an angle to the normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.03** Apply the relationship between the speed of light in vacuum _c_ , the speed of light in a material _v_ , and the index of refraction of the material _n_ . \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.04** Apply the relationship between a distance _L_ in a material, the speed of light in that material, and the time required for a pulse of the light to travel through _L_ . \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.05** Apply Snell’s law of refraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.06** When light refracts through an interface, identify that the frequency does not change but the wavelength and effective speed do. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.07** Apply the relationship between the wavelength in vacuum l, the wavelength l _n_ in a material (the internal wavelength), and the index of refraction _n_ of the material. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.08** For light in a certain length of a material, calculate the number of internal wavelengths that fit into the length. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.09** If two light waves travel through different materials with different indexes of refraction and then reach a common point, determine their phase difference and interpret the resulting interference in terms of maximum brightness, intermediate brightness, and darkness. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.10** Apply the learning objectives of Module 17-3 (sound waves there, light waves here) to find the phase difference and interference of two waves that reach a common point after traveling paths of different lengths. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.11** Given the initial phase difference between two waves with the same wavelength, determine their phase difference after they travel through different path lengths and through different indexes of refraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **35.12** Identify that rainbows are examples of optical interference. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Ideas \n",
    "\n",
    "● The three-dimensional transmission of waves, including light, may often be predicted by Huygens’ principle, which states that all points on a wavefront serve as point sources of spherical secondary wavelets. After a time _t_ , the new position of the wavefront will be that of a surface tangent to these secondary wavelets. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The law of refraction can be derived from Huygens’ \n",
    "\n",
    "- principle by assuming that the index of refraction of any medium is _n_ � _c_ / _v_ , in which _v_ is the speed of light in the medium and _c_ is the speed of light in vacuum. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The wavelength l _n_ of light in a medium depends on the \n",
    "\n",
    "- index of refraction _n_ of the medium: \n",
    "\n",
    "in which l is the wavelength in vacuum. \n",
    "\n",
    "● Because of this dependency, the phase difference between two waves can change if they pass through different materials with different indexes of refraction.\n"
