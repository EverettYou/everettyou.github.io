        "- At that time, $^{235}\\text{U}$ was ~3% of uranium (vs ~0.7% today) because it decays faster than $^{238}\\text{U}$. Combined with the right geology (ore concentration, water as moderator), a critical chain reaction was possible.\n",

When the water cooled and returned, moderation resumed → reaction could start again. This cyclic behavior prevented a runaway; the reactor operated intermittently over hundreds of thousands of years.\n",
