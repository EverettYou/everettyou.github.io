Each photon is detected at a *random* point, but the distribution of many detections matches the interference pattern. The photon travels as a **probability wave**—we interpret the wave amplitude as governing the probability of absorption at each point. We cannot say which slit a given photon \"went through\"; we only know it was emitted and later absorbed.\n",
