        "\n",
        "For an **electron**, the act of detection *does* alter its state. To determine position very precisely, we need short-wavelength light (high resolution). But a short-wavelength photon carries large momentum; when it scatters from the electron, it transfers momentum and changes the electron's motion. The more precisely we fix $\\Delta x$ (smaller $\\Delta x$), the more we disturb the momentum—the larger $\\Delta p_x$ becomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conversely, to measure momentum very precisely, we need a long-wavelength probe (small momentum transfer). But a long-wavelength wave is spread out—it cannot localize the electron. So a small $\\Delta p_x$ implies a large $\\Delta x$. The uncertainties are linked: decreasing one increases the other.\n",

Thus $\\Delta p_x \\approx 0$. By the uncertainty principle, $\\Delta x \\geq \\hbar/(2\\Delta p_x) \\to \\infty$: the position is completely uncertain.
