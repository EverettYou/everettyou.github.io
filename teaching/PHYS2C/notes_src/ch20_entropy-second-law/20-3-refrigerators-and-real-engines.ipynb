    "- **20.16** Identify that a refrigerator is a device that uses work to transfer energy from a low-temperature reservoir to a high-temperature reservoir, and that an ideal refrigerator is one that does this with reversible processes and no wasteful losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **20.17** Sketch a _p-V_ diagram for the cycle of a Carnot refrigerator, indicating the direction of cycling, the nature of the processes involved, the work done during each process (including algebraic sign), the net work done in the cycle, \n",

    "- and the heat transferred during each process (including algebraic sign). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **20.18** Apply the relationship between the coefficient of performance _K_ and the heat exchanges with the reservoirs and the temperatures of the reservoirs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **20.19** Identify that there is no ideal refrigerator in which all of the energy extracted from the low-temperature reservoir is transferred to the high-temperature reservoir. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **20.20** Identify that the efficiency of a real engine is less than that of the ideal Carnot engine. \n",

    "● A perfect refrigerator is an entirely imaginary refrigerator in which energy extracted as heat from the low-temperature reservoir is somehow converted completely to heat discharged to the high-temperature reservoir without any need for work. \n",
    "\n",
    "● A perfect refrigerator would violate the second law of thermodynamics, which can be restated as follows: No series of processes is possible whose sole result is the transfer of energy as heat from a reservoir at a given temperature to a reservoir at a higher temperature (without work being involved). \n",

    "**Figure 20-14** The elements of a refrigerator. The two black arrowheads on the central loop suggest the working substance operating in a cycle, as if on a _p-V_ plot. Energy is transferred as heat _Q_ L to the working substance from the low-temperature reservoir. Energy is transferred as heat _Q_ H to the high-temperature reservoir from the working substance. Work _W_ is done on the refrigerator (on the working substance) by something in the environment.\n"
