    "● Mechanical waves can exist only in material media and are governed by Newton’s laws. Transverse mechanical waves, like those on a stretched string, are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the wave’s direction of travel. Waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate parallel to the wave’s direction of travel are longitudinal waves. \n",

    "- A sinusoidal wave moving in the positive direction of an \n",

    "- _x_ axis has the mathematical form \n",
    "\n",
    "where _ym_ is the amplitude (magnitude of the maximum displacement) of the wave, _k_ is the angular wave number, v is the angular frequency, and _kx_ � v _t_ is the phase. The wavelength l is related to _k_ by \n",
    "\n",
    "- The period _T_ and frequency _f_ of the wave are related to v by \n",

    "- The wave speed _v_ (the speed of the wave along the string) is \n",
    "\n",
    "- related to these other parameters by \n",

    "can represent a traveling wave with a wave speed as given above and a wave shape given by the mathematical form of _h_ . The plus sign denotes a wave traveling in the negative direction of the _x_ axis, and the minus sign a wave traveling in the positive direction. \n",
