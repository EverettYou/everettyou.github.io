    "- A spherical mirror is in the shape of a small section of a \n",
    "\n",
    "- spherical surface and can be concave (the radius of curvature _r_ is a positive quantity), convex ( _r_ is a negative quantity), or plane (flat, _r_ is infinite). \n",
    "\n",
    "● If parallel rays are sent into a (spherical) concave mirror parallel to the central axis, the reflected rays pass through a common point (a real focus _F_ ) at a distance _f_ (a positive quantity) from the mirror. If they are sent toward a (spherical) convex mirror, backward extensions of the reflected rays pass through a common point (a virtual focus _F_ ) at a distance _f_ (a negative quantity) from the mirror. \n",
    "\n",
    "● A concave mirror can form a real image (if the object is outside the focal point) or a virtual image (if the object is inside the focal point). \n",
    "\n",
    "● A convex mirror can form only a virtual image. \n",
    "\n",
    "● The mirror equation relates an object distance _p_ , the mirror’s focal length _f_ and radius of curvature _r_ , and the image distance _i_ : \n",
    "\n",
    "● The magnitude of the lateral magnification _m_ of an object is the ratio of the image height _h_ � to object height _h_ , \n",
    "\n",
    "and is related to the object distance _p_ and image distance _i_ by \n",
