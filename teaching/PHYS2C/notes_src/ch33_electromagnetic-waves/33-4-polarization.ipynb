    "\n",
    "● Electromagnetic waves are polarized if their electric field vectors are all in a single plane, called the plane of oscillation. Light waves from common sources are not polarized; that is, they are unpolarized, or polarized randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When a polarizing sheet is placed in the path of light, only \n",
    "\n",
    "- electric field components of the light parallel to the sheet’s polarizing direction are transmitted by the sheet; components perpendicular to the polarizing direction are absorbed. The light that emerges from a polarizing sheet is polarized parallel to the polarizing direction of the sheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "● If the original light is initially unpolarized, the transmitted intensity _I_ is half the original intensity _I_ 0: _I_ �[1] 2 _[I]_[0][.] \n",
    "\n",
    "● If the original light is initially polarized, the transmitted intensity depends on the angle u between the polarization direction of the original light and the polarizing direction of the sheet: \n",
