## Review & Summary

Properties of Atoms
  Atoms have quantized energy levels. The electron has **spin** $s = 1/2$ and **orbital angular momentum** $\ell = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$ (with $m_\ell = -\ell, \ldots, +\ell$). The combination determines the magnetic properties and the structure of the periodic table.

The Stern-Gerlach Experiment
  A beam of silver atoms passing through an *inhomogeneous* magnetic field splits into discrete beams. This reveals that the magnetic moment (and thus angular momentum) is quantized. The two beams correspond to the two possible values of the $z$-component of electron spin: $S_z = \pm \hbar/2$.

Magnetic Resonance
  **Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)** and **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** exploit the precession of magnetic moments in an external magnetic field $\vec{B}$. The **Larmor frequency** is $\omega_L = \gamma B$, where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio. Resonance occurs when an applied RF field matches this frequency, causing transitions between spin states.

Exclusion Principle and Multiple Electrons
  The **Pauli exclusion principle:** no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers $(n, \ell, m_\ell, m_s)$. This determines the maximum occupancy of each subshell (e.g., 2 electrons per orbital) and the structure of multi-electron atoms.

Building the Periodic Table
  The periodic table is built by filling orbitals in order of increasing energy: $1s$, $2s$, $2p$, $3s$, $3p$, $4s$, $3d$, $\ldots$ **Hund's rule:** when filling degenerate orbitals (e.g., the three $p$ orbitals), maximize the total spin—place electrons in separate orbitals with parallel spins before pairing.

X Rays and the Ordering of the Elements
  **Characteristic x-rays** are emitted when a high-energy electron knocks out an inner-shell electron and an outer electron falls into the vacancy. The frequency of the $K_\alpha$ line obeys **Moseley's law:** $\sqrt{f} \propto Z - 1$, where $Z$ is the atomic number. This established the ordering of elements in the periodic table.

Lasers
  A **laser** (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) produces coherent, monochromatic, highly directional light. **Stimulated emission** occurs when an incident photon induces an excited atom to emit a photon in phase with the incident one. **Population inversion** (more atoms in the upper state than the lower) is required for net amplification. Applications include spectroscopy, communications, medicine, and manufacturing.
