      "source": "## Lecture Notes\n\n### Overview\n\n- **Single-slit diffraction**: Light passing through a narrow slit produces a **diffraction pattern**\u2014a broad central maximum, narrower secondary maxima, and minima in between. This is interference of Huygens wavelets from different points within the slit.\n- **Minima** occur when $a\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$ ($m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$). **Maxima** lie approximately halfway between adjacent minima.\n- **Narrower slit** $\\Rightarrow$ more diffraction (wider pattern). Diffraction limits geometrical optics when apertures are comparable to $\\lambda$.\n\n---\n\n### Diffraction and the diffraction pattern\n\nWhen waves pass through an aperture or past an edge comparable in size to the wavelength, they **spread** (diffract) and **interfere** with themselves. The result is a **diffraction pattern**.\n\nFor a **long narrow slit** of width $a$ illuminated by monochromatic light:\n\n- **Central maximum**: broad, intense. All Huygens wavelets from the slit travel nearly the same distance to the center $\\Rightarrow$ in phase.\n- **Secondary maxima**: narrower, less intense, on both sides.\n- **Minima**: dark fringes between the maxima.\n\nGeometrical optics would predict a sharp slit image; the actual pattern shows that light is a wave.\n\n:::{admonition} Diffraction vs. double-slit interference\n:class: note\n\n**Double-slit** (Ch. 35): two coherent sources; path length difference $d\\sin\\theta$ determines bright/dark. **Single-slit**: many sources across the slit; we find minima by pairing zones that cancel.\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Locating the minima: the zone method\n\nTo find the **first minimum**, divide the slit into **two zones** of width $a/2$ each. Consider rays from corresponding points in the two zones (e.g., top of each zone) reaching a point $P_1$ at angle $\\theta$.\n\n**Path length difference** between the two rays: $(a/2)\\sin\\theta$ (from the geometry when $D \\gg a$).\n\nFor **destructive interference**, this difference must be $\\lambda/2$\u2014so the two rays cancel. Every such pair cancels; the whole slit contributes zero at $P_1$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{2}\\sin\\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a\\sin\\theta = \\lambda\n$$ (eq-first-min)\n\n**Second minimum**: Divide the slit into **four** zones. Pairs from adjacent zones cancel when $(a/4)\\sin\\theta = \\lambda/2$ $\\Rightarrow$ $a\\sin\\theta = 2\\lambda$.\n\n**All minima**:\n\n$$\na\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda, \\quad m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\n$$ (eq-all-min)\n\n($m = 0$ gives $\\theta = 0$, the center\u2014a maximum, not a minimum.)\n\n**Maxima**: Approximately halfway between minima (e.g., first side maximum near $a\\sin\\theta \\approx 1.5\\lambda$). Exact positions require the intensity analysis of section 36-2.\n\n---\n\n### Slit width and wavelength\n\nFrom $a\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$:\n\n| Change | Effect on pattern |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| **Narrower** slit ($a \\downarrow$) | $\\theta$ increases $\\Rightarrow$ pattern **expands** |\n| **Longer** wavelength ($\\lambda \\uparrow$) | $\\theta$ increases $\\Rightarrow$ pattern **expands** |\n\nWhen $a = \\lambda$, the first minimum is at $\\theta = 90\u00b0$\u2014the central maximum fills the entire screen. Diffraction is strongest when the aperture is on the order of the wavelength.\n\n---\n\n### Distance on the screen\n\nWhen $\\theta$ is small, $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$. The distance $y$ from the center to the $m$th minimum is\n\n$$\ny \\approx D\\theta \\approx D\\,\\frac{m\\lambda}{a}\n$$ (eq-y-min)\n\nwhere $D$ is the slit-to-screen distance. The **width of the central maximum** (distance between first minima) is $\\approx 2D\\lambda/a$.\n\n:::{admonition} Poll: Central maximum width\u2014effect of slit width\n:class: poll dropdown\n\nA single slit of width $a$ produces a central diffraction maximum of width $l$. You decrease the slit width to $a/2$. What is the new width of the central maximum?\n\n- (A) $l/2$\n- (B) $l$\n- (C) $2l$\n- (D) $4l$\n:::\n\n:::{admonition} Poll: Central maximum\u2014effect of wavelength\n:class: poll dropdown\n\nSame slit. You switch from 600 nm to 500 nm light. How does the width of the central bright fringe change?\n\n- (A) Increases\n- (B) Decreases\n- (C) Stays the same\n- (D) Depends on the slit width\n:::\n\n---\n\n### The Fresnel bright spot\n\nIn 1819, Poisson (a Newtonian) argued that Fresnel's wave theory predicted a **bright spot** at the center of the shadow of a sphere\u2014seemingly absurd. The experiment showed the spot was there. This **Fresnel bright spot** supported the wave theory: light diffracts around the edge and interferes constructively at the center of the shadow.\n\n:::{admonition} Example: First minimum angle\n:class: seealso dropdown\n\nWhite light through a slit. First minimum for red ($\\lambda = 650$ nm) at $\\theta = 15\u00b0$: $a = \\lambda/\\sin\\theta = 650\\,\\text{nm}/\\sin 15\u00b0 \\approx 2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. The slit must be very narrow\u2014a few wavelengths.\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Single-slit diffraction**: central maximum + secondary maxima separated by minima.\n- **Minima**: $a\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$, $m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ (zone method: pair canceling waves).\n- **Narrower slit or longer $\\lambda$** $\\Rightarrow$ pattern expands.\n- **Fresnel bright spot**: bright spot in shadow of disk/sphere; supports wave theory."
