      "source": "## Lecture Notes\n\n### Overview\n\n- **Double-slit with finite slit width**: The pattern combines **double-slit interference** (Ch. 35) and **single-slit diffraction** (Ch. 36). The single-slit pattern acts as an **envelope** that modulates the intensity of the interference fringes.\n- **Intensity**: $I = I_m (\\sin\\alpha/\\alpha)^2 \\cos^2\\beta$, where the diffraction factor $(\\sin\\alpha/\\alpha)^2$ and the interference factor $\\cos^2\\beta$ multiply.\n- **Diffraction minima** eliminate some double-slit fringes. The ratio $d/a$ determines how many interference maxima fit within each diffraction peak.\n\n---\n\n### Combining interference and diffraction\n\nIn Chapter 35 we assumed slits so narrow ($a \\ll \\lambda$) that the single-slit diffraction pattern spread over the entire screen\u2014all interference fringes had roughly equal intensity.\n\nFor **actual slits** with width $a$ comparable to $\\lambda$:\n\n- **Double-slit interference** still determines the *positions* of bright and dark fringes: $d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$ (bright), $d\\sin\\theta = (m+\\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$ (dark).\n- **Single-slit diffraction** modulates the *intensity*: the broad central maximum and weaker side maxima of each slit's diffraction pattern act as an **envelope**.\n- Where the diffraction pattern has a minimum, the intensity is zero\u2014even at angles that would be interference maxima for infinitely narrow slits. Some double-slit fringes are **missing**.\n\n---\n\n### Intensity formula\n\nFor two identical slits of width $a$ and center-to-center separation $d$:\n\n$$\nI = I_m \\left(\\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right)^2 \\cos^2\\beta\n$$ (eq-double-slit-diff)\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi a}{\\lambda}\\,\\sin\\theta, \\qquad \\beta = \\frac{\\pi d}{\\lambda}\\,\\sin\\theta\n$$ (eq-alpha-beta)\n\n- **Diffraction factor** $(\\sin\\alpha/\\alpha)^2$: from single-slit diffraction (section 36-2). Zero when $a\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$ ($m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$).\n- **Interference factor** $\\cos^2\\beta$: from two-slit interference (section 35-3). Maxima when $d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$; minima when $d\\sin\\theta = (m+\\frac{1}{2})\\lambda$.\n\nThe intensity is the *product* of both factors. Both must be nonzero for a bright fringe.\n\n:::{admonition} Limiting cases\n:class: note\n\n- $a \\to 0$: $(\\sin\\alpha/\\alpha) \\to 1$; reduces to pure two-slit interference (Ch. 35).\n- $d \\to 0$: $\\cos^2\\beta \\to 1$; reduces to pure single-slit diffraction.\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Counting fringes in the central peak\n\nThe **central peak** of the diffraction envelope extends from the first diffraction minimum on one side to the first on the other: $a\\sin\\theta = \\pm\\lambda$.\n\n**Double-slit bright fringes** occur at $d\\sin\\theta = m\\lambda$ ($m = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\ldots$).\n\nAt the first diffraction minimum, $a\\sin\\theta = \\lambda$. The corresponding double-slit order is $m = d\\sin\\theta/\\lambda = d/a$. So fringes with $|m| < d/a$ lie inside the central peak. The number of bright fringes in the central peak is\n\n$$\n2\\lfloor d/a \\rfloor + 1 \\quad \\text{(or } 2d/a - 1 \\text{ if } d/a \\text{ is an integer)}\n$$ (eq-fringe-count)\n\nWhen $d/a$ is an integer, the diffraction minimum falls exactly on a would-be interference maximum, so that fringe has zero intensity (\"missing order\").\n\n**First side peak** (between first and second diffraction minima): extends from $a\\sin\\theta = \\lambda$ to $a\\sin\\theta = 2\\lambda$. Double-slit orders from $m = \\lceil d/a \\rceil$ to $m = \\lfloor 2d/a \\rfloor - 1$ (on one side). Typically about $d/a$ fringes per side peak.\n\n:::{admonition} Poll: Slit width from interference pattern\n:class: poll dropdown\n\nThe figure shows the interference pattern from two slits separated by 0.26 mm. What is the width of each slit?\n\n[FIGURE: Double-slit intensity pattern showing diffraction envelope and interference fringes; indicate which orders are missing\u2014e.g., if $m=10$ is the first missing order, then $d/a = 10$, so $a = d/10 = 0.026$ mm]\n\n- (A) 0.010 mm\n- (B) 0.013 mm\n- (C) 0.020 mm\n- (D) 0.026 mm\n:::\n\n:::{admonition} Example: $d/a = 4.8$\n:class: seealso dropdown\n\n$d = 19.44$ mm, $a = 4.05$ mm $\\Rightarrow$ $d/a \\approx 4.8$. Central peak contains $m = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 4$: **9 bright fringes**. The $m = 5$ fringe falls near the first diffraction minimum and is nearly eliminated. First side peak: $m = 5$ to $9$ on one side (5 fringes).\n:::\n\n:::{admonition} Example: Bright fringes between diffraction minima\n:class: seealso dropdown\n\nA double-slit has slit width $a = 46\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and slit separation $d = 0.30$ mm. How many complete bright fringes appear between the two first-order minima of the diffraction pattern?\n\n**Solution:** First diffraction minima at $a\\sin\\theta = \\pm\\lambda$. At that angle, $d\\sin\\theta = d\\lambda/a = 0.30\\times10^{-3}/(46\\times10^{-6}) \\approx 6.5$. So interference orders $m = 0, \\pm1, \\ldots, \\pm6$ lie inside the central diffraction peak. Total: **13** bright fringes (or 11 if $m=\\pm6$ falls exactly on the minimum).\n:::\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Double-slit diffraction**: interference ($d\\sin\\theta$) modulated by diffraction envelope ($a\\sin\\theta$).\n- **Intensity**: $I = I_m (\\sin\\alpha/\\alpha)^2 \\cos^2\\beta$; $\\alpha = (\\pi a/\\lambda)\\sin\\theta$, $\\beta = (\\pi d/\\lambda)\\sin\\theta$.\n- **Central peak**: contains $\\sim 2d/a$ bright fringes (or $2\\lfloor d/a \\rfloor + 1$). Diffraction minima eliminate fringes when $d/a$ is integer."
